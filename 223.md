# `increaseVouch` lacks `whenNotPaused`

### Summary

All of the functions inside these contracts implement `whenNotPaused`. Such a function is used to protect users and their funds during a hack. This is done by pausing the whole contract so that the hacker would not be able to steal any funds and users would not be able to increase the value of those contracts, as that value could potentially be stolen.


However the issue here is that `increaseVouch` lacks `whenNotPaused`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426
```solidity
  function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable nonReentrant {
    if (msg.value < configuredMinimumVouchAmount) {
      revert MinimumVouchAmount(configuredMinimumVouchAmount);
    }
```

### Root Cause

`increaseVouch` not having `whenNotPaused`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426
```solidity
  function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable nonReentrant {
    if (msg.value < configuredMinimumVouchAmount) {
      revert MinimumVouchAmount(configuredMinimumVouchAmount);
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

A hack to happen
The admins to react to that hack and pause the system before any more funds are stolen.

### Attack Path

1. Hacker manages to exploit the `EthosVouch` at time T and steal 40% of it's funds
2. Admins act quick and pause the contracts T+5 min
3. It's displayed publicly that the system has been hacked at T+15min (10min after the pause)


However between the time that the admins pause the contract and that it's displayed publicly that the system have been hacked a few might call `increaseVouch`. Not on purpose to get exploited, but just as normal behavior as they won't know that a hack has happened. Thus they would increase the potential amount that can be stolen.

### Impact

User will send more funds to a project that is already in danger. Pausing mechanism will not work.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add `whenNotPaused` to `increaseVouch`:

```diff
-   function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable nonReentrant {
+   function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
```
