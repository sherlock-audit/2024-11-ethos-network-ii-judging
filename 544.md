# Total fees can exceed 10% in `ReputationMarket` contract causing users to pay much more fees than assured by the protocol.

### Summary

Protocol specifies that maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%. This invirant can be broken by the protocol and maximum total fees paid by users can exceed 10%.

### Root Cause

We can see that protocol uses `MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE_BASIS_POINTS` and `MAX_DONATION_BASIS_POINTS` to bound the fees value in the protocol. These values are set to 500 bps which sums up to 1000 bps. 1000 bps is equal to 10%. However the protocol charges users 3 different fees.

`donationBasisPoints` which can be set to 500.
`entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints` which can be set to 500.
`exitProtocolFeeBasisPoints` which can also be set to 500.

If we sum these values up we can see that maximum possible fee that the user will be charged can be greater than 10%.

The protocol states that `Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%`. As we can see maximum `TOTAL` fee can be greater than 10% which breaks the assumption about protocol fees. The protocol can charge higher fees than it should be.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

### Impact

User can pay bigger fees than asured by the protocol. This unexpected fees will lead to loss of funds for a user.

`PLEASE note that this report describes an issue inside ReputationMarket contract only.`

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Bound the fees so that they cannot exceed 10%.
