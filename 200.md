# Admin Can Set Max Total Fees to Exceed 10%

### Summary

The README specifies that total fees across the contracts must not exceed `10%` (`1000 BPS`). However, the `EthosVouch` contract allows administrators to set the total fees up to `100%` (`10000 BPS`).


### Root Cause

- The constant `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is set mistakenly to `10000` (`100%`):
  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120
  ```solidity
    uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
  ```
- The contract allows administrators to set fees that sum up to `100%`:
  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L1003

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Admin set `entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints = exitFeeBasisPoints = entryDonationFeeBasisPoints = entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints = 2500`.
2. As a result, max total fee is `10000 BPS = 100%` which is greater than `10%`.


### Impact

As per README:
> Are there any limitations on values set by admins (or other roles) in the codebase, including restrictions on array lengths?
> For both contracts:
> - Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%

Broken README because admin can exceeds the limitation on values.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` to `1000` (`10%`).
```diff
- uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
+ uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000;
```
