# Anyone can withdraw all of `initialLiquidity` whenever the market starts with the default market configuration(Default tier).

### Summary

> **What properties/invariants do you want to hold even if breaking them has a low/unknown impact?**
> 
> The vouch and vault contracts must never revert a transaction due to running out of funds.
> 
> Reputation Markets must never sell the initial votes. **_They must never pay out the initial liquidity deposited._** The only way to access those funds is to graduate the market.

Anyone can withdraw all of the `initialLiquidity` if the market starts with the default market configuration(Default tier).

A malicious user can buy votes at a low price and then sell them at a high price.  
The buying strategy at a low price involves purchasing a trust vote, then buying a distrust vote, and repeating this process.  
The total buying prices are calculated as follows: 1/2 + 1/3 + 2/4 + 2/5 + 3/6 + 3/7 + ...

The selling strategy at a high price involves selling all of the distrust votes first, and then selling all of the trust votes except for the base votes (one trust vote and one distrust vote).  
The total selling prices if the total votes are 9, are calculated as follows: 3/8 + 2/7 + 1/6 + 4/5 + 3/4 + 2/3 + 1/2.

The more votes that are bought, the higher the potential margin.

### Attack Path

1. A malicious user is monitoring the network.

2. If a market is started, the malicious user purchases 21 votes using a low-priced buying strategy immediately.

3. And then the user first sells all of the distrust votes and then sells all of the trust votes.

### Impact

The market owner loses a significant portion of market creator's base liquidity.

### PoC

As a result, the market owner loses a significant portion of market creator's base liquidity.
This can also be tested.

```javascript
const _1E18 = 1e18
const BASE_VOTES = 2
/// DEFAULT_PRICE is 0.01 ether
const DEFAULT_PRICE = 0.01
const DEFAULT_GAS_LIMIT = 21000 / _1E18

const buyVotesAlternately = (n) => {
	let sum = 0

	for(let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		const k = BASE_VOTES + i
		const a = Math.floor(k / 2)
		sum += a / k
	}
	return sum * DEFAULT_PRICE
}

const sellVotesTrustAndThenDisTrust = (n) => {
	let sum = 0

	const edgePoint = Math.floor((n + 1) / 2)
	for(let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		if (i < edgePoint) {
			sum += (i + 1) / (i + 2)
		} else {
			sum += (i - edgePoint + 1) / (i + 2)
		}
	}
	return sum * DEFAULT_PRICE
}

const Result = (n) => {
	const totalAmountBuyVotes = buyVotesAlternately(n)
	const totalAmountSellVotes = sellVotesTrustAndThenDisTrust(n)
	const maximumFeeAndDonation = totalAmountBuyVotes / 10 + totalAmountSellVotes / 20
	const normalGasPrice = (n + 2) * DEFAULT_GAS_LIMIT
	const gain = totalAmountSellVotes - totalAmountBuyVotes - maximumFeeAndDonation - normalGasPrice
	console.log(`Total amount buy votes: ${totalAmountBuyVotes} ether`)
	console.log(`Total amount sell votes: ${totalAmountSellVotes} ether`)
	console.log(`Margin: ${totalAmountSellVotes - totalAmountBuyVotes} ether`)
	console.log(`Maximum value of fees and donation: ${maximumFeeAndDonation} ether`)
	console.log(`Total gas price: About ${normalGasPrice} ether`)
	console.log(`Gain: ${gain} ether`)
}
```

Results of   `Result(21)`

- Total amount of bought votes: 0.09909562711110699 ether
- Total amount of sold votes: 0.11845558457710162 ether
- Margin: 0.01935995746599463 ether
- Maximum value of fees and donations: 0.01583234193996578 ether
- Total gas price: Approximately 4.83e-13 ether
- Gain: 0.0035276155255458503 ether

As observed from the results, the malicious user can obtain a gain of 0.00352761552514685 ether, while the market owner incurs a loss of 0.01935995746599463 ether, given that the initial liquidity is 0.02 ether when using the default market configuration(Default tier).

### Mitigation

1. **Increase Initial Votes**
- Propose an increase in the initial number of votes.

2. **Adjust Maximum Donation to 6%**
- The current maximum donation and fees are set at 5%. However, since the **maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%**, the market owner may have the option to set donations and fees at 6% and 4%, respectively. This adjustment could help address the issue.

3. **Set Limits on the Amount of Votes Users Can Buy/Sell**
- Establish a limit on the number of votes that users can buy or sell, based on the total votes available in the market.
