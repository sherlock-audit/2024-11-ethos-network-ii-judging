# Donation rewards to mocks ids can forever be locked in the vouch contract

### Summary

The ethosVouch contract allows vouching for mock profile subject ids, and a portion of the vounch amount is given to the mock subject id as a donation reward.

```solidity
    // you may not vouch for archived profiles
    // however, you may vouch for verified AND mock profiles
    // we allow vouching for mock profiles in case they are later verified
    if (archived || (!mock && !verified)) {
      revert InvalidEthosProfileForVouch(subjectProfileId);
    }
```

Giving fees to the mockId:
```solidity
    if (donationFee > 0) {
        _depositRewards(donationFee, subjectProfileId);
      }
```

 An issue arises when claiming rewards as this mock id should have been claimed by a verified address with a verified profile id being the mockId. 
 
 There are two ways of creating mockId in the ethosReview contract, one is via address  nad the other via attestastion hash. The mockId via address can be claimed by the address and hence can claim the rewards to that mockid. 
 
 `Increment call to create mockId by the ETHOS_REVIEW contract in EthosProfile contract.`

 ```solidity
    function incrementProfileCount(
    bool isAttestation,
    address subject,
    bytes32 attestation
  ) external whenNotPaused onlyNonCompromisedAddress(subject) returns (uint256 profileId) {
    if (
      msg.sender != contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_REVIEW) &&
      msg.sender != contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_ATTESTATION)
    ) {
      revert InvalidSender();
    }
    profileId = profileCount;
    if (isAttestation) {
      profileIdByAttestation[attestation] = profileId;
    } else {
      profileIdByAddress[subject] = profileId;
    }
    profileCount++;

    emit MockProfileCreated(profileId);
  }

 ```

 An issue arises with the mockId created via attestation hash, this mockId cannot be claimed by an address since during a claim, the attestation hash's profile id is changed to the claimant's id. 
 
 ```solidity
    function assignExistingProfileToAttestation(
    bytes32 attestationHash,
    uint256 profileId
  ) external isEthosAttestation whenNotPaused {
    profileIdByAttestation[attestationHash] = profileId;
  }
 ```
 - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L297C1-L302C4
 
 Since the rewards are assigned to the mockId, the claimant of the attestation hash cannot claim these rewards and this amount will forever be stuck in the vouch contract.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Here is a scenario:-
- A voucher sees a social profiles' attestation hash with a mockId and wants to vouch for it hence he vouchs for it using its mockId.
- The vouch gets created for that mockid as a subject id and the donation rewards is awarded to that mockId.
- In ethos attestation, the attestation hash is claimed by its owner address and its id changed to the owner address's profile id.
- The attestation owner cannot claim this reward, since he has a different profile id and nobody can take ownership of this mock id to which the funds were assigned hence will forever be stuck in the contract.

### Impact

Funds will forever get stuck in the vouch contract

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider assigning reward funds to addresses or attestation hashes.
