# The ReputationMarket will allow participants to retain their status even after selling all their votes, leading to potential market manipulation.

### Summary

The absence of a mechanism to update the `isParticipant` mapping when shares are sold will cause a logical flaw for participants as users will be able to falsely appear as active market participants even after selling their votes.


### Root Cause

In the [ReputationMarket.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495) contract, there is a missing update in the `sellVotes` function that fails to set `isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender]` to `false` when a user sells all their votes. 
The comment in the code states at [ReputationMarket.sol:120](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L120):
```solidity
// append only; don't bother removing. Use isParticipant to check if they've sold all their votes.
```
This indicates that the `isParticipant` mapping is meant to determine whether a user is genuinely participating based on their current vote holdings. The lack of an update to this mapping allows users to remain in the `participants` array without holding any votes, leading to potential manipulation of market sentiment.



### Internal pre-conditions

1. User needs to buy votes to set their address in the `participants` array.
2. User needs to sell votes to attempt to change their voting status.
3. User needs to have sold all votes for the condition to check and update `isParticipant` mapping.

### External pre-conditions

Market must be active for users to buy or sell votes.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls `buyVotes` to purchase votes, thereby being added to the `participants` array.
2. The user then calls `sellVotes` but does not trigger an update to `isParticipant`.
3. The user retains their status as a participant despite having no votes, which poses a potential risk of manipulating market perceptions without holding any voting power.

### Impact

The participants could  suffer an approximate loss of trust in the reputation system. The attacker could potentially gains the ability to influence market sentiment without holding any voting power, undermining the integrity of the market.

### Mitigation

```solidity
function sellVotes(uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    // Logic for selling shares...

    // Check if user has sold all votes
    if (votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[TRUST] == 0 && votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[DISTRUST] == 0) {
        isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = false;
    }
    
    ....
}
```
