# users pay fee more than expected in EthosVouch::vouchByAddress

### Summary

users pay fee more than expected in `EthosVouch::vouchByAddress`

### Root Cause

to compute protocolFee, donationFee and vouchersPoolFee  and then sum all of them as totalFee causes user pay more fee than usual

### PoC

**Textual PoC:**
let's assume userA want to vouch 1 eth and total fee is 7% hence,userA pay 1.07 eth 

protocol fee is 200[2%] ,donationFee is 200[2%] and vouchersPoolFee is 300[3%]
```rust
protocol fee = 1.07e18 - ((1.07e18 * 10000) / 10200) ‎ = 2.098e16
donationFee = 1.07e18 - ((1.07e18 * 10000) / 10200) ‎ = 2.098e16
vouchersPoolFee = 1.07e18 - ((1.07e18 * 10000) / 10300) ‎ = 3.117e16
total_fee = 2.098e16 + 2.098e16 + 3.117e16 ‎ = 7.313e16 
```
as we can see user 0.07313 eth as pay but user should pay 0.07 eth as a pay its mean user pay 0.003 eth more than usual
0.003 eth * 3500[eth price] = $10.5

### Imapct
users pay fee more than expected in `EthosVouch::vouchByAddress`

### Mitigation

consider to compute total fee and then split that
```rust

total_fee = (1.07 * 10000) / 10700 ‎ = 1
1.07 - 1 ‎ = 0.07=> total_fee
and now
total percentage = 200 + 200 + 300 = 700
0.07 * 200 / 700 = 0.02 eth => protocol fee
0.07 * 200 / 700 = 0.02 eth => donationFee
0.07 * 300 / 700 = 0.03 eth => vouchersPoolFee
```
