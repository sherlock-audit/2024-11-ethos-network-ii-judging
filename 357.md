# When buying votes, fees are taken from the whole `msg.value` instead of the amount spent on votes.

### Summary
When buying votes, fees are taken from the whole `msg.value` instead of the actual amount spent on votes

```solidity
  function _calculateBuy(
    Market memory market,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 funds
  )
    private
    view
    returns (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      uint256 newVotePrice,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    )
  {
    uint256 fundsAvailable;
    (fundsAvailable, protocolFee, donation) = previewFees(funds, true);
    uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);

    uint256 minPrice = votePrice;
    uint256 maxPrice;

    if (fundsAvailable < votePrice) {
      revert InsufficientFunds();
    }

    while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
      fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
      fundsPaid += votePrice;
      votesBought++;

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    }
```

As we can see the loop ends when there are not enough funds to cover a purchase for the next vote. This usually results in refund later being sent to the user. Current implementation charges fees on unused by the user amount. Numerical example written bellow.

### Root Cause

Wrong fee logic implemented.

### Attack Path
1. User calls `buyVotes` with 0.9 eth, `minVotesOut == 1 eth`. Current vote price is 0.5 eth.
2. User is charged 10% fee on the 0.9 eth -> 0.09 eth fee.
3. User only spends 0.5 eth on votes.
4. User is only refunded 0.31 eth. They're effectively charged 0.09 eth fee on a 0.5 eth buy, which is a 18% fee instead of a 10% one.
5. Had the user just sent ~0.56 eth, their tx would've succeeded. Because they sent more funds, they lost additional 0.03 eth.

### Impact

Loss of funds

### Mitigation
Fix is non-trivial
