# No slippage protection in `ReputationMarket.sellVotes()`

## Summary

`ReputationMarket.sellVotes()` allows selling votes however does not offer slippage protection, as a result, users may receive fewer ETH than they expected.

## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the following scenario:

1. Alice sees on the UI or via `simulateSell()` function that she will receive 1 ETH for her vote if she will sell now.
2. Alice starts the transaction via `sellVotes()`.
3. However Bob's sell transaction to sell 10 votes is already in flight and thus lends first in the Base L2 Sequencer feed.
4. Alice's transaction lends next, yielding much less amount than she was expecting.

## Impact

Users receive fewer funds than they were shown on UI or via `simulateSell()`.

## Recommendation

Allow sellers to specify slippage based on the expected amount and maximum acceptable percent of deviation.
