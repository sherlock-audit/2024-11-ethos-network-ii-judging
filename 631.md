# improper votePrice accounting in sellVote() leads to user getting less eth and protocol loss too.

### Summary

Calculating vote price is done in a wrong way in sell vote function. user will get less eth , when he will sell votes than he should actually get. 

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1026C1-L1040C6

in particular this function, vote price is being calculates before the funds recieved for that partiuclar loop. which was already calculated before . so one time extra vote price is being calculated which result in, less funds recieved back to the user.
instead it should be calculated like it was done in buy vote

### Attack Path

lets consider a scenario , 

A user want to sell 4 trust votes, right now for that market total votes are 12 . 6 are trust and 6 are distrust. 
now when user sell this tokens , and the time 

fundsReceived += votePrice; 

is being calculated. votePrice would (5 * baseprice/ 11), which really should be (6*basePrice/12). this is because already 2 times vote has been calculated and after 1st time . votes is being minused too before calling 2nd time.

so in this , when all 4 tokens price would be calculated , he will end in getting less funds recieved than he should actuall, or funds he has paid to buy votes in a particular way calculation

### Impact

user will get less funds , also protocol fee is also being calculated on this funds recieved, so protocol will also get less exit fee.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

funds recieved should be calculated first and then again calc price should be done for further loop.
