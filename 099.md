# `increaseVouch` can be called even if EthosVouch is paused

### Summary

The `whenNotPaused` modifier is included in all functions except for `increaseVouch`. This is problematic as in case there is an issue in the protocol and the contract is paused vouches can still be increased.

### Root Cause

The `whenNotPaused` modifier is missing in the `increaseVouch` function: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. EthosVouch gets paused, perhaps due to an issue, in order to prevent calls from being made to the contract.
2. `increaseVouch` can still be called, even though it should not be possible.

### Impact

When EthosVouch is paused `increaseVouch` can still be called, even though it should be prohibited. This will be problematic if calls need to be paused following a future upgrade, a potential bug, etc.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include the `whenNotPaused` modifier to `increaseVouch`.
