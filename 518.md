# Admin can manipulate with exitFeeBasisPoints after deployment

### Summary

Admin before deployment can set exitFeeBasisPoints low, but after deployment can change up to 100% which can drain all funds of authors during unvouching. 

### Root Cause

- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L961 toDeposit can be zero if amount == exitFee, 
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L955 exitFeeBasisPoints is not limited, which can bring exitFee == amount.
