# Missing check in `withdrawDonations()` allows compromised/deleted address to steal all donation

## Description
The [withdrawDonations()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L570-L574) function makes no check if the calling address has been marked compromised (or deleted from the profile) or not:
```js
  File: ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol

   570:            function withdrawDonations() public whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
   571:@--->         uint256 amount = donationEscrow[msg.sender];
   572:              if (amount == 0) {
   573:                revert InsufficientFunds();
   574:              }
   575:          
   576:              // Reset escrow balance before transfer to prevent reentrancy
   577:              donationEscrow[msg.sender] = 0;
   578:          
   579:              // Transfer the funds
   580:              (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: amount }("");
   581:              if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Donation withdrawal failed");
   582:          
   583:              emit DonationWithdrawn(msg.sender, amount);
   584:              return amount;
   585:            }
```

This leads to the following vulnerability:
1. Alice creates a profile and sets `donationRecipient[profileId]` to address A1. All donations are now updated in `donationEscrow[A1]`.
2. A1 gets compromised and Alice marks it as compromised using her other address A2. (Alternatively, A1 is deleted by Alice and A1 gets assigned to some other profile id).
3. The attacker who compromised A1 can still call `withdrawDonations()`.
4. Note that Alice can't use A2 to call `updateDonationRecipient()` and change the recipient or pull out the donated funds since it can only be called by the current recipient which is A1.
4. A1 calls `withdrawDonations()` and the funds get sent to them.
5. Alice has no recourse to block the attacker's actions or recover her funds.

## Impact
A couple of them:
1. A compromised/deleted address is able to steal the funds via `withdrawDonations()`.
2. Even if a check is introduced to block such addresses from receiving funds, there exists no way to rescue these funds or set a new recipient.

## Proof of Concept
Add this test file as `ethos/packages/contracts/test/reputationMarket/rep.compromised.test.ts` and see it pass when run via `npm run hardhat -- test --grep "Compromised address vulnerability"`:

            // First register newWallet's address

            // Verify donations were cleared

                .to.equal(0);
        });
    });
});
```

## Mitigation 
1. Add the check to revert if a compromised/deleted address attempts to call `withdrawDonations()`. Note that we need not bother about `updateDonationRecipient()` since even if it is called by A1, it can only set the new recipient to some address belonging to the existing profile:
```diff
-  570:            function withdrawDonations() public whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
+  570:            function withdrawDonations(uint256 profileId) public whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
+  571:              uint256 callerProfileId = _getProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);
+  571:              if (msg.sender != donationRecipient[profileId] || callerProfileId != profileId) revert InvalidProfileId();
   571:              uint256 amount = donationEscrow[msg.sender];
   572:              if (amount == 0) {
   573:                revert InsufficientFunds();
   574:              }
   575:          
   576:              // Reset escrow balance before transfer to prevent reentrancy
   577:              donationEscrow[msg.sender] = 0;
   578:          
   579:              // Transfer the funds
   580:              (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: amount }("");
   581:              if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Donation withdrawal failed");
   582:          
   583:              emit DonationWithdrawn(msg.sender, amount);
   584:              return amount;
   585:            }
```

2. The second fix is more of a design decision which the protocol can take. There should be a way to recover the donation. Either a new convenience function `reassignDonationRecipient()` can be added which looks something like this:
```js
function reassignDonationRecipient(
    uint256 profileId, 
    address newRecipient,
    bytes calldata signature  // Signed proof of new address ownership
) external {
```
Or the admin could float a proposal which allows them to rescue funds from such markets, and introduce a new function for the same.
