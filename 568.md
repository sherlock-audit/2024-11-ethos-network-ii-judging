# Not using the upgradeable version of ReentrancyGuard result in storage clashes in upgradeable contracts.

### Summary

[EthosVouch.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L67) and [ReputationMarket.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L36) are both UUPSUpgradeable contracts but both inherit Openzeppelin's ReentrancyGuard.sol, which is not meant for upgreadable contracts. This will results in storage clashes and corrupted data in the proxy and implementation. 

### Root Cause

Both contracts inherit the wrong version of Openzeppelin's ReentrancyGuard.

```solidity 

contract EthosVouch is AccessControl, UUPSUpgradeable, ITargetStatus, ReentrancyGuard {

contract ReputationMarket is AccessControl, UUPSUpgradeable, ReentrancyGuard {
```

### Impact

[ReentrancyGuard.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/6e05b68bd96ab90a4049adb89f20fd578404b274/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol#L47C3-L49C6) doesnt have its storage variables stored in random slots like [ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.sol](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/e26285b811cfab8a779994549b94219fc96a6013/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.sol#L60C1-L66C33). It uses a constructor. The upgradeable version uses initialization to set up the variables used in the nonReentrant modifier. This will lead to storage misalignment in the proxy pattern when deploying  and upgrading contracts.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.sol instead of ReentrancyGuard.sol
