# Incorrect Hardcoded Maximum Fee Limit in `EthosVouch.sol`

### Summary

The `EthosVouch.sol` contract defines a `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` constant with a value of `10000` (representing 100% in basis points). However, the contest's README specifies that the maximum total fees should not exceed 10%. This discrepancy creates a misalignment between the stated business logic and the implemented contract logic, potentially leading to unintended behavior if the contract relies on this value for validation.

### Root Cause

The `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` constant in the contract is hardcoded as `10000` basis points (100%), which contradicts the README's limitation of a 10% maximum total fee.

### Internal pre-conditions

* The contract relies on `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` for fee-related calculations and validations.
* The value of `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is set to 10000 basis points (100%) in the code.

### External pre-conditions

* The fee-related operations or calculations are configured using the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` constant.
* The administrator or owner unintentionally or maliciously sets total fees exceeding 10%, leveraging the higher limit in the contract.

### Attack Path

* An administrator sets fee-related parameters (e.g., entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints, entryDonationFeeBasisPoints, and entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints) to a total exceeding 10%.
* The contract allows these configurations since it relies on `MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000`.
* Users are charged excessive fees (up to 100%) contrary to the README-specified 10% limit.

### Impact

 Users may be charged excessive fees beyond the specified 10% limit.

### PoC

This is what the contest README states under:
Are there any limitations on values set by admins (or other roles) in the codebase, including restrictions on array lengths?
`For both contracts:
Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%`

```Solidity
  uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;

``` 


### Mitigation

Modify the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` constant to correctly reflect the 10% maximum fee as specified in the README:

```Solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000; // 10% in basis points
```
