# Overwithdrawal Due to Misaccounted Market Funds

### Summary

When a user calls `buyVotes()` on a market, the `marketFunds` state variable incorrectly tracks funds by including protocol fees and donations in its total, leading to an over-withdrawal when markets are graduated. While protocol fees are immediately sent to `protocolFeeAddress` and donations are tracked in `donationEscrow`, these amounts remain counted in `marketFunds`. This double counting causes the protocol to withdraw more funds than it should when calling `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()`.

### Root Cause

In the `_calculateBuy()` function,  fees and donations are added to `fundsPaid`, rather than just the amount paid for votes:

Then in `buyVotes()`, `marketFunds` is increased by `fundsPaid`:

### Internal pre-conditions

1. At least the protocol fee or donation fee is non-zero
2. Market is graduated
3. `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` is called

### External pre-conditions

1. 2 or more markets are created
2. Votes are purchases for 2 or more markets

### Attack Path

1. A market is created
2. A user calls `buyVotes()` to buy votes for that market. `marketFunds` is increased by the amount the user paid for votes + the protocol fee + the donation amount. Fees are sent to the protocol and donations are updated.
3. The donation recipient calls `withdrawDonations` to withdraw their donations.
4. The protocol graduates the market and then calls `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` which withdraws not just the amount the user paid for votes, but also the protocol fee and donations again.

### Impact

Loss of funds since protocol fee and donations are being double counted.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Don't include the protocol fee and the donation amount when updating marketFunds
