# Upgrading Contracts can cause Storage collision

### Summary

The contracts are upgradable without using custom storage locations nor a gap, which will make contracts 


### Root Cause

The contracts `ReputationMarket` and `EthosVouch` both uses `ReentrancyGuard` which stored the status of the contract entered or not in `slot0`

[EthosVouch.sol#L67](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L67) | [ReputationMarket.sol#L36](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L36)
```solidity
contract EthosVouch is AccessControl, UUPSUpgradeable, ITargetStatus, ReentrancyGuard {
                                                                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
// ---------------

contract ReputationMarket is AccessControl, UUPSUpgradeable, ReentrancyGuard {
                                                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
```

And their contract `ReputationMarket` is not having a GAP.

Not just ReentrancyGuard, but `AccessControl` inherits from  `SignatureControl` which implements two variants and mapping also without a GAP.

[utils/SignatureControl.sol#L11-L15](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/SignatureControl.sol#L11-L15)
```solidity
abstract contract SignatureControl is Initializable {
  address public expectedSigner;
  address public signatureVerifier;

  mapping(bytes => bool) public signatureUsed;
  ...
```

This will cause storage collision when upgrading contracts, in case of adding another contract to access control or inheriting another contract before `ReentrancyGuard` contract, which will lead to storage collision.

In case of collision in Reentrancy variable, the reentrancy modifier will get corrupted, and not work.

### Mitigation

Use the Upgradable Reentrancy version, and make a gap in `SignatureControl` or use random Storage Slot.
