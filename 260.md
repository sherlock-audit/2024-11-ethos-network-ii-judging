# Same recipient address for different markets and in function updateDonationRecipient() will update all money from the old recipient address into the new one

### Summary

There is not limit for one recipient address to only serve for one market which means one address can serve as the recipient address for multiple markets. And the function updaDonationRecipient will swap all the donation balance from old to new.

### Root Cause

Firstly there is no limitation for recipient address to only serve for one market. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L341
And In the function updateDonationRecipient(), https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L544-L564 The function is to update the donation recipient for a market. In the function, it should only update profileId market recipient. While the variable donationEscrow is the accumulated money of one recipient of all the markets it serve. donationEscrow[newRecipient] += donationEscrow[msg.sender]; will transfer all the money from all markets into profileId market. If one only want to update one market recipient to a new one, he will lose all the other markets' donation.
