# Users always pay higher fees in EthosVouch.sol

### Summary

EthosVouch.sol overestimates fees to pay, so users always pay higher fees. That's because fee formula overestimates result when called multiple times with partial fee.

### Root Cause

-The choice to use `calcFee()` multiple times makes final fees higher than expected. As it is formula used in `calcFee()` is OK, however by design it will calculate higher fees when called multiple times for partial fee.

### Attack Path

1. Suppose `protocolFee = 3%`, `donationFee = 3%`, `vouchersPoolFee = 4%`. So total fee is 10%.
2. User calls `vouchByProfileId()` and submits 1 ETH. According to [formula in `calcFee()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L976-L985) it must calculate `1 - 1 * 100% / 110%` = 0.091 ETH.
3. However in 3 different calls it [will calculate](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=%281+-+1+*+100%25+%2F+103%25%29+%2B+%281+-+1+*+100%25+%2F+103%25%29+%2B+%281+-+1+*+100%25+%2F+104%25%29) 0.096 ETH. Which is [5.5% higher](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=%280.096+-+0.091%29+%2F+0.091+*+100) fee rate than expected.

### Impact

Protocol always overcharges users with additional fee due to incorrect calculation. For example extra 10.05% instead of 10%.

### Mitigation

Calculate fee amount at once, and than divide it into different fee types according to weights.
