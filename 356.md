# EthosVouch.sol :: slash() can be avoided by frontrunning, enabling users to bypass the slashing process.

### Summary

The `slash()` is used to penalize a specific `authorProfileId` by deducting a percentage of their vouches balance for bad behavior. However, a user can frontrun this transaction by calling `unvouchin()`, allowing them to avoid the penalty.

### Root Cause

`slash()` is implemented as follows.
```solidity
function slash(
    uint256 authorProfileId,
    uint256 slashBasisPoints
  ) external onlySlasher whenNotPaused nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
    if (slashBasisPoints > MAX_SLASH_PERCENTAGE) {
      revert InvalidSlashPercentage();
    }

    uint256 totalSlashed;
    uint256[] storage vouchIds = vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId];

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchIds.length; i++) {
      Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];
      // Only slash active vouches
@>    if (!vouch.archived) {
        uint256 slashAmount = vouch.balance.mulDiv(
          slashBasisPoints,
          BASIS_POINT_SCALE,
          Math.Rounding.Floor
        );
        if (slashAmount > 0) {
          vouch.balance -= slashAmount;
          totalSlashed += slashAmount;
        }
      }
    }

    if (totalSlashed > 0) {
      // Send slashed funds to protocol fee address
      (bool success, ) = protocolFeeAddress.call{ value: totalSlashed }("");
      if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Slash transfer failed");
    }

    emit Slashed(authorProfileId, slashBasisPoints, totalSlashed);
    return totalSlashed;
  }
```
As you can see, only active vouches can be slashed. If a user notices the `slash()` transaction in the mempool, they can call [unvouch()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L463) to archive their vouch and avoid being penalized.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

- `slash()` must be invoked by the designated slasher.
- User detects the transction in the mempool.

### Attack Path

1. slasher calls `slash()`.
2. The user detects the transaction in the mempool.
3. The user frontruns the transaction by calling `unvouch()` to archive their vouch, thereby avoiding the slash.

### Impact

Users can circumvent the slashing of their voucher balances.

### PoC

To better understand the issue, let's consider an example. For the attack to benefit the user, the `slashBasisPoints > exitFee`. Assume the user has only 1 vouch, and the `exitFee = 5%`.  

1. The slasher calls `slash()` with `slashBasisPoints = 10%`.  
2. The user notices the transaction in the mempool and frontruns it by calling `unvouch()`.  
3. The user archives the vouch and withdraws the corresponding `amount - exitFee`.  
4. The `slash()` transaction is executed, but it has no effect since the vouch has already been archived.  
5. As a result, the user incurs only a 5% loss due to the `exitFee`, instead of the 10% loss from the slash.  

### Mitigation

To address the issue, implement a mechanism to queue `unvouch()` requests, preventing users from frontrunning the `slash()` operation.
