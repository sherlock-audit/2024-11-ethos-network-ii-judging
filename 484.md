# Fees are charged on the entire funds amount instead of what is used for vote purchase

### Summary

When buying votes, the preview fees function will base the fees on the msg.value sent not the actual value used to purchase an actual vote. 

This creates a problem where a user sends 1 eth and the votes cost is 0.6, he will buy 1 vote and 0.4 eth should be refunded. The problem is that the preview fees function will charge fees on the 1 eth instead on the 0.6 eth used to actually buy the vote. This causes excess fees to be applied to the user.

```solidity
  function buyVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 expectedVotes,
    uint256 slippageBasisPoints
  ) public payable whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // Determine how many votes can be bought with the funds provided
    (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);
```
we can observe the buyVotes function and the call to _calculateBuy includes msg.value as the 3rd argument.

we can observe the _calculateBuy function below.

```solidity
  function _calculateBuy(
    Market memory market,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 funds
  )
    private
    view
    returns (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      uint256 newVotePrice,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    )
  {
    uint256 fundsAvailable;
    (fundsAvailable, protocolFee, donation) = previewFees(funds, true);
    uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);

    uint256 minPrice = votePrice;
    uint256 maxPrice;

    if (fundsAvailable < votePrice) {
      revert InsufficientFunds();
    }

    while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
      fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
      fundsPaid += votePrice;
      votesBought++;

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    }
    fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;

    maxPrice = votePrice;

    return (votesBought, fundsPaid, votePrice, protocolFee, donation, minPrice, maxPrice);
  }
```
we can see that the 3rd arguement which was set to msg.value, is funds.
Going more into the snippet we see that we call previewFees with funds which is msg.value. This means even the funds  not used to purchase a vote will be charged a fee.

The user should not be charged fees on eth that was not used to enter the market. Instead the user should be charged only fees on the amount used up to buy the actual votes. for example if the user sent 1 eth and the vote cost 0.6 eth, you should calculate the fees on the 0.6eth used to buy the vote and subtract this amount from the 0.4 eth. Instead by charging fees on msg.value, the user is paying almost double the amount of fees he should.

For example the fee calculation should go as follows.
1. user sends 1 eth 
2. vote cost is 0.6 eth
3. user buys 1 vote
4. 10% fee is charged on 0.6 eth which equals 0.06 eth fee.
5. user is returned 0.4 - 0.06 eth which is 0.34 eth.

Instead this is how the fee is currently calculated...
1. user sends 1 eth 
2. vote cost is 0.6 eth
3. user is charged 10% fee on 1 eth = 0.1 eth
4. user buys 1 vote for 0.6 eth.
5. user is returned 0.4 - 0.1 eth which is 0.3 eth.

### Attack Path

1. user sends 1 eth 
2. vote cost 0.6eth
3. user buys 1 vote
4. user is actually charged fees on the 1 eth sent instead of the 0.6eth used to buy the vote. lets assume fees are at max 10%
5. user is charged 0.1 eth fee.
6. user will be refunded 0.3 eth, if the fee was correct he should be refunded 0.34 eth. This is because 0.6 eth x 10% is 0.06 eth. 0.4 - 0.06 = 0.34 eth that should be refunded if the fee calculation was correct.
7. user will be charged fees on funds that where not used to enter the market.

### Impact

A user is charged excess fees on eth that was not used to buy vote. This can result in users paying nearly double the fee amounts.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

first calculate the cost of a vote, then apply the fee on the number of votes bought.

Since fees will never exceed 10 % set aside 10% of the available funds for a fee buffer.

assuming that the vote cost is 0.2 eth and the user sends 1 eth. 
1. reduce the available funds by 10% and call this value fundsAvailableMinusFeeBuffer for example. The 10% should be called FeeBuffer
2. the fundsAvailableMinusFeeBuffer = 0.9 eth. 
3. the user is eligible to buy around 4 votes for approximately 0.8eth.
4. charge 10% fee on 0.8eth = 0.08 eth
5. feeBuffer - 0.08 eth = 0.02 eth set this value to feeBufferMinusFees
6. refund = feeBufferMinusFees + (fundsAvailableMinusFeeBuffer - the funds used to to purchase actual votes)
7. the refund should be around .12 eth
8. send user the refund.

here we implement a system that allows the users funds to buy as many votes as his funds allow but always ensures there is enough eth to pay the fees even after votes are bought.
