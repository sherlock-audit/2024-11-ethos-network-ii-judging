Cheery Mustard Swallow

# Malicious users can completely evade the slashing in `EthosVouch::slash` by unvouching before `slash` is called, due to the missing 24h lockdown period implementation, resulting in lost slashing fees for Ethos

### Summary

The `EthosVouch` system lacks the critical 24hours lockdown implementation during the accusations period that's explicitly specified in the whitepaper documentation. This allows users anticipating slashing actions to preemptively completely withdraw their funds through unvouching, completely evading the protocol's punishment mechanism and denying the pledged whistleblower their deserved reward, even if the frontend blocks certain operations like unvouching as the 24 hour period begins, with the current unvouch implementation the user can still interact with unvouch directly at the smart contract level and withdraw all vouched eth. 

### Root Cause

The vulnerability exists due to a significant discrepancy between the whitepaper specification that can be found [here](https://whitepaper.ethos.network/ethos-mechanisms/slash) and the smart contract implementation regarding the accusation and slashing process.
The whitepaper states:

"_This accusation triggers a 24h lock on staking (and withdrawals) for the accused_"

However, the current implementation of the unvouch function has no such restriction in [EthosVouch.sol:452](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L452-L481)

### Internal pre-conditions

- Missing 24 hour lockdown on potential 10% in slashing fees implementation in `invouch`
- Whistleblower lays a complaint against the profile or multiple profiles leave negative reviews with proof.
- Potentially a front-end 24 hour usage limitation is imposed.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

SETUP
User has 10 ETH in active vouches across multiple Profiles

ATTACK
1. User commits unethical behavior
2. Multiple users leave bad reviews with proof
3. User sees these reviews and anticipates slash
4. User calls the unvouch function on all their active vouches

5. When slash comes, no funds are available
// Will slash 0 ETH because all vouches are archived

### Impact

This vulnerability fundamentally breaks the protocol's punishment mechanism:

- Complete evasion of the 10% slashing penalty through preemptive unvouching
- Direct financial loss to protocol (slashing fees) and whistleblowers (rewards)
- Systemic risk as malicious actors can operate without fear of effective punishment
- Undermines the entire trust system by making bad actors effectively unpunishable

### PoC

Initial State:
- Malicious user has 10 ETH staked across profiles
- Profile IDs: [1, 2, 3]
- Vouch IDs: [100, 101, 102]

Attack Flow:
1. User sees negative reviews on their profile
2. User calls `unvouch`
3. Repeat for all active vouches
4. When `slash` is called, it affects 0 ETH

Result:
- Expected slash amount: 1 ETH (10% of 10 ETH)
- Actual slash amount: 0 ETH
- Protocol Loss: 1 ETH
- Whistleblower Loss: Expected reward from slash

### Mitigation

Implement the 24-hour lockdown period as specified in the whitepaper within the unvouch function

```solidity
mapping(uint256 => uint256) public profileLockdownUntil;  // profileId => timestamp

modifier notInLockdown(uint256 profileId) {
    require(block.timestamp >= profileLockdownUntil[profileId], "Profile in lockdown");
    _;
}

function initiateAccusation(uint256 profileId) external {
    profileLockdownUntil[profileId] = block.timestamp + 24 hours;
    emit AccusationInitiated(profileId);
}

function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public 
    whenNotPaused 
    nonReentrant 
    notInLockdown(vouches[vouchId].authorProfileId)  // Add lockdown check
{
    // ... existing unvouch logic
}
```

- Alternatively consider implementing a partial lockdown that reserves 10% of all vouched amounts for 24 hours. This allows users to withdraw 90% of their stake if they wish to withdraw while securing the potential slash amount until the accusation period ends.
- Consider implementing a grace period during which unvouching is disabled after receiving multiple negative reviews or reports.
- Add an accusation status tracking mechanism to ensure the 24-hour lockdown is properly enforced.
