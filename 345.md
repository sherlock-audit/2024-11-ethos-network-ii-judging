# Market funds for a profile ID are set higher than the actual funds causing revert in withdrawl

### Summary

When a user buys a vote then a part of the total funds paid by the user goes to the protocol and donation and the rest should go to the market funds for later withdraw by the graduation contract upon graduation. But in the `buyVotes` function; the market fund for a profile ID is added with the total funds spent by the user. This is inclusive of the protocol and donation Fee.

The protocol fee goes directly to the protocol fee address while the donation fee goes to the escrow that can be withdrawn anytime by the owner of the profile. If this gets added to the market funds of the profile ID then upon graduation of a profile, `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` function will send more funds than the actual market fund causing either less funds in the `ReputationMarket` contract  or will cause the function to revert because of insufficient funds.

### Root Cause

In `ReputationMarket::buyVotes` function line: 

`marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;`

The `fundsPaid` variable includes the actual funds paid to buy the votes, the protocol fee and the donation fee (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L978). 

This gets added to the market funds which will cause lower funds in the `ReputationMarket` contract upon graduation or revert if there are insufficient funds in the contract.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

The Attack will happen naturally as the graduation contract tries to withdraw the market funds for a profile ID from the `ReputationMarket` contract upon graduation.

### Impact

The `ReputationMarket` contract ends up with lower funds if the graduation contract withdraws some market funds. Eventually if it tries to withdraw all the market funds across all the profiles then this will cause a revert due to insufficient funds.

### PoC
Let us assume the following:

funds to buy the votes = 1 eth
protocol fee = 10% of funds = 0.1 eth
donation fee = 10% of funds = 0.1 eth
remaining funds to buy the vote from market = 1 - 0.2 = 0.8 eth

What buyVotes is adding:-
marketFunds[user] += 1 eth

What buyVotes should add:-
marketFunds[user] += 0.8 eth

### Mitigation

The marketFunds should be updated with the following change:

`marketFunds[profileId] += (fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation);`
