# Improper fee mechanism in the `EthosVouch.applyFees()` function.

### Summary

In the `applyFees()` function, the total amount is divided into four parts: `protocolFee`, `donationFee`, `vouchersPoolFee`, and `toDeposit`. The first three are fees, while `toDeposit` is allocated for the vouch.

The division should satisfy the following ratio:

```solidity
  protocolFee : donationFee : vouchersPoolFee
              
    = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints : entryDonationFeeBasisPoints : entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints
```

However, the current mechanism does not satisfy this requirement.

### Root Cause

As shown in the [applyFees()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L936-L938) function, `protocolFee`, `donationFee`, and `vouchersPoolFee` are calculated separately using the `calcFee()` function.

```solidity
       function applyFees(
         uint256 amount,
         bool isEntry,
         uint256 subjectProfileId
       ) internal returns (uint256 toDeposit, uint256 totalFees) {
         if (isEntry) {
           // Calculate entry fees
936:       uint256 protocolFee = calcFee(amount, entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints);
937:       uint256 donationFee = calcFee(amount, entryDonationFeeBasisPoints);
938:       uint256 vouchersPoolFee = calcFee(amount, entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints);
     
           ...

951:       totalFees = protocolFee + donationFee + vouchersPoolFee;
952:       toDeposit = amount - totalFees;
         ...
       }
```

The [calcFee()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L987-L988) function divides the input amount into two parts based on the input ratio.

```solidity
       function calcFee(uint256 total, uint256 feeBasisPoints) internal pure returns (uint256 fee) {
         ...
         
         return
987:       total -
988:       (total.mulDiv(BASIS_POINT_SCALE, (BASIS_POINT_SCALE + feeBasisPoints), Math.Rounding.Floor));
       }
```

Since the three fee calculations are performed separately, their ratio does not satisfy the desired one.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

Let's consider the following scenario:

- Assumptions:

    - entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints = 2.5%
    - entryDonationFeeBasisPoints = 2.5%
    - entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints = 5%
- Under these assumptions, the expected total fee is `0.1 / 1.1` of the total amount.

- Current implementation:

    - protocolFee = calcFee(amount, 0.025) = `amount * 0.025 / 1.025`;
    - donationFee = calcFee(amount, 0.025) = `amount * 0.025 / 1.025`;
    - vouchersPoolFee = calcFee(amount, 0.05) = `amount * 0.05 / 1.05`;
    - As a result, their ratio is: `(0.025 / 1.025) : (0.025 / 1.025) : (0.05 / 1.05)`.

    This ratio differs from the desired ratio of `2.5 : 2.5 : 5`.

The current implementation does not satisfy the desired ratio between fees, and the total fee amount is greater than expected. In this scenario, the loss percentage is calculated as follows:

    (0.025 / 1.025 + 0.025 / 1.025 + 0.05 / 1.05) - 0.1 / 1.1 = 0.0055

Comparing it to the desired total fee, we find that `0.0055 / (0.1 / 1.1) = 0.06`, which equals a difference of 6%.

The loss depends on the three fee percentages.

### Impact

The total fee is greater than expected, resulting in a loss of funds.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Consolidate fee calculations into a single location.

```solidity
       uint256 totalFeeBasisPoints = 10000 + entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints
                                           + entryDonationFeeBasisPoints
                                           + entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints;

       uint256 protocolFee = amount * entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints / totalFeeBasisPoints;
       uint256 donationFee = amount * entryDonationFeeBasisPoints / totalFeeBasisPoints;
       uint256 vouchersPoolFee = amount * entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints / totalFeeBasisPoints;
```
