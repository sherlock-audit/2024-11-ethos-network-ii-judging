# Wrong calculation in Market Funds During Vote Selling

### Summary

A logical accounting error will cause inaccurate market funds tracking as the current implementation fails to properly account for protocol fees during vote sales

### Root Cause

in `ReputationMarket.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L522 the market funds update mechanism in the `sellVotes()`  function incorrectly calculates the reduction in market funds by omitting protocol fees

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User needs to call `sellVotes()` function to sell votes
2. Sufficient votes exist for the specified market profile
3. Protocol fee is generated during the vote sale transaction
4. `marketFunds[profileId]` has sufficient balance



### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls `sellVotes()` function to sell votes
2. Function calculates `fundsReceived` for votes sold
3. `marketFunds[profileId]` is reduced only by `fundsReceived`
4. Protocol fee is not subtracted from `marketFunds[profileId]`
5. Market funds tracking becomes mathematically inconsistent

### Impact

The protocol suffers from:

- Inaccurate market funds tracking
- Potential misrepresentation of total market value
- Risk of incorrect accounting during market operations
- Discrepancies in fund balance calculations

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the market funds update to include protocol fees 

```solidity 
// Before (Vulnerable)
marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;

// After (Corrected)
marketFunds[profileId] -= (fundsReceived + protocolFee);
```
