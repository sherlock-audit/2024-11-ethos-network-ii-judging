# selling amount of the last vote will always be zero

### Summary

The `_calcVotePrice`  calculates price for a vote by the formula
`(market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] * market.basePrice) / totalVotes`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L922

However when the last vote is calculated, the price should be 1*base_price/(1 + oppositeTrust_votes)
this is not the case because of a calculation order error, thus price ends up being 0.


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1026-L1038

The root cause is that the initial `_calcVotePrice` is not taken into account for `fundsReceived `.
The market.votes for the TRUST or DISTRUST value is subtracted, which would make the formula for price 0, only then the `fundsReceived` is updated.

The order of calculations completely neglect the initial price of the vote.
Thus the seller receives 0 amount when its the last vote is sold.

```diff
    uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);

    uint256 maxPrice = votePrice;
    uint256 minPrice;

    while (votesSold < amount) {
+      fundsReceived += votePrice;
      if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
        revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
      }

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
-      fundsReceived += votePrice;
      votesSold++;
      //@audit the first votePrice isn't taken into account, so when market.votes[isPosivitive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] is zero (last vote)
      // thhe vote price will be zero.
    }
