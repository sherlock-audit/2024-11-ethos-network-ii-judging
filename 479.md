# Compromised address of the Voucher can unvouch and steal the vouch money due to lack of proper validation

### Summary

If the address the user used to vouch gets compromised/hacked , it will be able to easily steal the user's entire vouch money due to lack of proper validations in EthosVouch.unvouch()

### Root Cause

EthosVouch.unvouch() lack proper validations which causes compromised user address to unvouch and steal users'money

```Solidity
function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
    _vouchShouldExist(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);
    // because it's $$$, you can only withdraw/unvouch to the same address you used to vouch
    // however, we don't care about the status of the address's profile; funds are always attached
    // to an address, not a profile
    if (vouches[vouchId].authorAddress != msg.sender) {
      revert AddressNotVouchAuthor(vouchId, msg.sender, vouches[vouchId].authorAddress);
    }

    v.archived = true;
    // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
    v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt = block.timestamp;
    // remove the vouch from the tracking arrays and index mappings
    _removeVouchFromArrays(v);

    // apply fees and determine how much is left to send back to the author
    (uint256 toWithdraw, ) = applyFees(v.balance, false, v.subjectProfileId);
    // set the balance to 0 and save back to storage
    v.balance = 0;
    // send the funds to the author
    // note: it sends it to the same address that vouched; not the one that called unvouch
    (bool success, ) = payable(v.authorAddress).call{ value: toWithdraw }("");
    if (!success) {
      revert FeeTransferFailed("Failed to send ETH to author");
    }

    emit Unvouched(v.vouchId, v.authorProfileId, v.subjectProfileId);
  }
```

Proper validation for compromised address checks like EthosProfile.IsAddressCompromised[msg.sender] should be used before an address can execute unvouch.


### Impact

If the profile address used to vouch gets compromised/hacked , it will be able to unvouch and steal the user's enitre vouch money due to lack of proper validations

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement validations to ensure address calling unvouch is not marked compromised:

`require(!EthosProfile.IsAddressCompromised[msg.sender],"Address Compromised");`
