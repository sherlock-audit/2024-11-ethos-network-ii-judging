# `EthosVouch` max fee can go up to 100%

### Summary

In README, it states that the max total fee cannot exceed 10%, which is 1000, however, this variable is incorrect written in contract, causing max fees can go over such value.

### Root Cause

Per README:
> For both contracts:
>  Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%

Which by the basis point in contract, it should be 1000, as 10000 means 100%, however, in contract:
```solidity
  uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
  uint256 public constant BASIS_POINT_SCALE = 10000;
```

The actual value is set to 10000, which is exactly 100%, way exceeding the limit.
