# In the `ReputationMarket.sellVotes()` function, `protocolFee` should also be deducted from `marketFunds` because `protocolFee` is already sent.

### Summary
If a user sells a vote immediately after buying it, he can make some profit due to the difference of two prices. A malicious user can drain a reputation market by repeating the action.

### Root Cause
When selling votes, `fundsReceived`, the amount of received funds is deducted from the `marketFunds`.(L522)

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L522
```solidity
522:        marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
```

However, `fundsReceived` does not include `protocolFee`.(When selling, no `donation`).
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1151
```solidity
        funds = amount - protocolFee - donation;
```

The `protocolFee` is amount of fees which was already sent to the protocol.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1123
```solidity
        (bool success, ) = protocolFeeAddress.call{ value: protocolFee }("");
```

So, the total amount of funds released form the market is the sum of `fundsReceived` and `protocolFee`, which results in an insufficient remaining ether balance in `ReputationMarket`

### External pre-conditions
none

### Attack Path
none

### Impact

An insufficient remaining ether balance in `ReputationMarket` results in a loss of funds for users.

### Mitigation

```diff
-       marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
+       marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived + protocolFee;
```
