# No removal of participants even after selling the votes

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

The participants array grows indefinitely as new users buy votes. This can lead to increased gas costs for operations involving the array (e.g., iterating over participants) and potentially excessive storage usage

```solidity
function buyVotes(...) {
  // ... code
  if (!isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender]) {
    participants[profileId].push(msg.sender); // Array grows indefinitely
    isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = true;
  }
  // ... 
}
```
In `sellVotes` no removal of participant from the array even if they sell all votes

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

 Increased gas costs could make certain contract functions prohibitively expensive. Excessive storage usage contributes to the overall blockchain state size.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a mechanism to remove participants from the array when they sell all their votes or use an alternative data structure
