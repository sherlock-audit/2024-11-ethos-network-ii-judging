# An attacker can understate `marketFunds` by selling votes, leading to unauthorized withdrawal.

### Summary

Incorrect accounting in `sellVotes` will cause unauthorized withdrawal of ETH for the protocol as an attacker will sell votes and `marketFunds[profileId]` is not reduced by the protocol fee amount.

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket.sellVotes: 522](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L522), the `marketFunds[profileId]` is incorrectly decreased in `sellVotes` only by `fundsReceived`, excluding the protocol fee, understating the market funds.

### Internal pre-conditions

> Protocol exit fees are set to a non-zero value.
> The attacker owns votes in the market.
> An active market exists for a specific profileId.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `sellVotes` to sell votes.
2. The `sellVotes` function subtracts `fundsReceived` from `marketFunds[profileId]`, excluding the protocol fee.
3. Repeating this action understates `marketFunds[profileId]`.
4. Upon market graduation, the understated `marketFunds` allows excess ETH to be withdrawn.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss of funds as excess ETH is withdrawn from the contract, potentially affecting other markets and participants.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In `sellVotes`, adjust `marketFunds` to decrease by the total amount removed, including the protocol fee:

```solidity
uint256 totalFundsRemoved = fundsReceived + protocolFee;
marketFunds[profileId] -= totalFundsRemoved;
```
