# The 72 grace period is not implemented which can allow multiple slashing in a very short time.

### Summary

The slashed profile should be protected by 72 hour grace period after it was slashed. However in current implementation the profile can be slashed multiple times in a very short time which will harm the slashed profile.

### Root Cause

The `slash` function does not offer 72 hours grace period.
