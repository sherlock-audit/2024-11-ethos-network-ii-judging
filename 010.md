# [M-2] Wrong `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` allows total fees to be set up to 100% instead of the expected 10%

### Summary

According to the contest's ReadMe under the section **Are there any limitations on values set by admins (or other roles) in the codebase, including restrictions on array lengths?**, the dev team said **Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%**.

Since fees are expressed in basis points, where `10_000` == 100%, the expected `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` should be `1_000`, but the code sets `uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;`. This allows the admin to bypass the expected 10% limit on max fees unintentionally.

For reference, the contest's ReadMe also says that **Maximum total slash cannot exceed 10%**, and the variable  `uint256 public constant MAX_SLASH_PERCENTAGE = 1000;` is set to 1_000. This further enforces the fact that `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` should also be 1_000.

### Root Cause

The constant variable `uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;` is declared as [10_000 instead of 1_000](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120). The fees can be set to 100%.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Admin calls `checkFeeExceedsMaximum` function trying to increase the fees, expecting that if fees are > 10% or 1_000 basis points the call will revert. Since fees can be set up to 100%, this function will only revert if fees go beyond 100%, breaking a core invariant of the protocol.

### Impact

Loss of funds for users, fees can be more than the expected 10%.

### PoC

Not needed.

### Mitigation

```diff
-    uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
+    uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000;
```
