# User will sell votes at an undesirable price

### Summary

The missing slippage protection in `ReputationMarket.sellVotes()` will impact users. Malicious user can sandwich and profit for them, basically stealing from honest users.

### Root Cause

In [`sellVotes()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L499) there is a missing slippage protection.

### Internal pre-conditions

To attack become profitable fees must be lower than revenue from sandwiching.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User1 submits `sellVotes()` expecting to receive for example 1 ETH.
2. User2 executes `sellVotes()`, so after sell price becomes lower.
3. User1 tx is executed, he receive lower than 1 ETH. Additionally makes price even lower
4. User2 buys back his votes at the lowered price.

User2 will profit as soon as price impact is higher than fees payed.

### Impact

Users always suffer loss on sell operations. Especially when price impact of sell is high.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Add slippage protection.
