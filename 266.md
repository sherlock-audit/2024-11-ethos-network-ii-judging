# Users Can Avoid Slashing by Archiving Vouches

### Summary

In the slash function of `EthosVouch.sol`, a vulnerability exists that allows users to `front-run the slashing process`. By detecting a pending slashing transaction, users can call a separate unvouch function to archive their vouches before the slashing execution. This prevents their balances from being slashed, undermining the intended functionality of the slash mechanism.

### Root Cause

```javascript
function slash(
    uint256 authorProfileId,
    uint256 slashBasisPoints
  ) external onlySlasher whenNotPaused nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
    if (slashBasisPoints > MAX_SLASH_PERCENTAGE) {
      revert InvalidSlashPercentage();
    }

    uint256 totalSlashed;
    uint256[] storage vouchIds = vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId];

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchIds.length; i++) {
      Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];
      // Only slash active vouches
      if (!vouch.archived) {
        uint256 slashAmount = vouch.balance.mulDiv(
          slashBasisPoints,
          BASIS_POINT_SCALE,
          Math.Rounding.Floor
        );
```
It should alos account for archived vouches

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A malicious user monitors for the initiation of the slash transaction (likely through mempool observation).
2. Upon detecting the slashing transaction targeting their authorProfileId, the attacker preemptively calls the unvouch function (or any function that archives their vouches).
3. This marks their vouches as archived, making them ineligible for slashing in the subsequent execution of the slash function.
4. The malicious user successfully avoids slashing 

### Impact

The protocol wont get fees from the user, leading to loss 

### PoC

### Mitigation

Introduce time-lock mechanisms to disallow immediate archiving of vouches after slashing is initiated.
