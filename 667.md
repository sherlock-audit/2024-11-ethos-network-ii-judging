# DoS to excceding limit of gas transaction in `ReputationMarket::buyVotes`

### Summary

In Reputation Markets, users are allowed to buy unlimited votes, this is showed by this [test](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/test/reputationMarket/rep.market.test.ts#L110C3-L118C6) in `ethos/packages/contracts/test/reputationMarket/rep.market.test.ts`.
The [`buyVotes`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442C3-L493C4) is implemented in a way that calculates the votes to buy using this while loop in [`_calculateBuy`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L942C3-L983C4):
```solidity
 while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
      fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
      fundsPaid += votePrice;
      votesBought++;

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    }
```
While `fundsAvailable` greater than `votePrice` the function continues to iterate.
This will lead to massive gas costs if a user wants to by 300ETH of a vote in the start of a market, exceeding the maximum amount of gas to a block in Ethereum, wich is 30M gas, provided by [etherscan](https://etherscan.io/blocks).

### Impact

If a user wants buys a lot of votes it will lead to DoS.

### PoC

Modify the current test in the file: 
`ethos/packages/contracts/test/reputationMarket/rep.market.test.ts` to:
```ts
it('should allow a user to buy unlimited positive votes', async () => {
    const amountToBuy = DEFAULT.buyAmount * 18000n;

    const { trustVotes: positive, distrustVotes: negative, gas } = await userA.buyVotes({
      buyAmount: amountToBuy,
      sellVotes: 0n
    });

    console.log(`Gas Used for buying ${amountToBuy} ETH worth of TRUST votes: ${positive}`);

    console.log(`Gas Used for buying ${positive} TRUST votes -> gas = ${gas.toString()}`);
    expect(negative).to.equal(0);
  });
```
the logs:

````bash
ReputationMarket
Gas Used for buying 180000000000000000000 ETH worth of TRUST votes: 18009
Gas Used for buying 18009 TRUST votes -> gas = 28233213
```

This PoC shows that if someone buys more than 20_000 votes the amount of gas in the transaction will exceed the maximum amount allowed and it will revert.

### Mitigation

Change the structure of `buyVotes` and `_calcVotePrice` so it doesn't iterate over the total valued of funds a profile has available to buy.
