# ReputationMarket does not implement `targetExistsAndAllowedForId()` function

### Summary

Ethos contracts should implement the `targetExistsAndAllowedForId()` function to check if an id exists for a contract. However, this function is not implemented in `ReputationMarket.sol`, which results in users being unable to add a reply or vote for a ReputationMarket entity.

### Root Cause

In the [EthosDiscussion::addReply()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosDiscussion.sol#L310) and [EthosVote::voteFor()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVote.sol#L140) functions, `ITargetStatus(targetContract).targetExistsAndAllowedForId(targetId)` is always checked. Since ReputationMarket doesn't implement this function, users cannot add a reply or vote for a ReputationMarket entity.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls `EthosVote::voteFor()` or `EthosDiscussion::addReply()` to add a reply or vote for a ReputationMarket entity, but the call reverts as `ReputationMarket.sol` does not implement `targetExistsAndAllowedForId()` function.

### Impact

Users cannot add a reply or vote for a ReputationMarket.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement the `targetExistsAndAllowedForId()` function for `ReputationMarket.sol`.
