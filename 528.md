# Users can interact with 'increaseVouch' while the contract is paused

### Summary

The missing whenNotPaused modifier in the increaseVouch function will cause a violation of the pause mechanism for all contract users as unintended transactions can occur during paused states.

### Root Cause

In `EthosVouch.sol:426`, the increaseVouch function lacks the whenNotPaused modifier, allowing it to be executed even when the contract is paused.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin must pause the contract by calling the pause() function.
2. Users must call increaseVouch() to increase the balance of an active vouch.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol’s pause mechanism fails to protect against unintended operations during paused states, potentially leading to:

- Unauthorized staking of funds.
- State inconsistencies during critical investigations or upgrades.
- Loss of user trust in the pause mechanism’s reliability.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the whenNotPaused modifier to the increaseVouch function:

`function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    ...
}`
