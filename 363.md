# The `EthosVouch` contract verifies that the maximum total fees do not exceed 100%, rather than 10%

### Summary

In the README, there is the following sentence: "Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%"
However, the `EthosVouch` contract checks that the maximum total fees exceeds 100% instead of 10%.
This breaks the requirement of the README.

### Root Cause

In the `EthosVouch` contract, `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is 10000(100%), not 1000 from [L120](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/tree/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120).

```solidity
120:   uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
```

Thus, the `checkFeeExceedsMaximum` function checks total fee is greater than 100% from L1003

```solidity
        function checkFeeExceedsMaximum(uint256 currentFee, uint256 newFee) internal view {
            uint256 totalFees = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints +
            exitFeeBasisPoints +
            entryDonationFeeBasisPoints +
            entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints +
            newFee -
            currentFee;
L1003:      if (totalFees > MAX_TOTAL_FEES) revert FeesExceedMaximum(totalFees, MAX_TOTAL_FEES);
        }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

1. None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The `EthosVouch` does not satisfy the requirement in the README.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

It is recommended to change the code in the `EthosVouch` contract as following:

```diff
-120:   uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
+120:   uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000;
```
