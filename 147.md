# `Donations` Not Subtracted from `marketFunds` in `withdrawDonations` Leads to Protocol Insolvency

### Summary

In the `ReputationMarket` contract, donations collected during `buyVotes` are stored in the [`donationEscrow`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1121) mapping.
and it's also counted in the [`marketFunds`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481)
When `withdrawDonations` is called, the donated funds are transferred to the designated recipient. However, these donations are not deducted from `marketFunds`, causing the marketFunds value to overestimate the actual funds available in the market.

This discrepancy can lead to insolvency where:

Withdrawals of marketFunds can ieither revert because they exceed the actual contract balance or they'll simply withdraw the donation balance too.
Funds from one market are drained to cover donation withdrawals or withdrawals from other markets.

### Root Cause


In ['_calculateBuy'](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L978) we calculate `fundsPaid` and then add `protocolFee ` and `donation` this amount is then added to marketFunds in `BuyVotes`
```javascript
   marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
 ``` 
However in `withdrawDonations` we don't deduct the donations from `marketFunds`
```javascript
function withdrawDonations() public whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
    uint256 amount = donationEscrow[msg.sender];
    if (amount == 0) {
      revert InsufficientFunds();
    }

    // Reset escrow balance before transfer to prevent reentrancy
    donationEscrow[msg.sender] = 0;

    // Transfer the funds
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: amount }("");
    if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Donation withdrawal failed");

    emit DonationWithdrawn(msg.sender, amount);
    return amount;
  }
```
  Also we have no guaratee that this function will be called before [`withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L660)



### Internal pre-conditions

Donations are added to donationEscrow during buyVotes and also accounted in `marketFunds`.
The total amount of donations is not deducted from `marketFunds`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

There are may scenarios for this:
There's a market with huge donation Amount.
`WithdrawDonations` is called and `donation` are sent to the `recepient`
after graduation, `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` is called and `donation` is double counted and also sent to the `authorizedAddress`
This might lead to depleting funds intended for other markets or causing a protocol failure due to insufficient balance.

### Impact

GraduateWithdrawals from one market can take funds intended for other markets.
The protocol becomes unable to honor market fund withdrawals, breaking its invariant `The vouch and vault contracts must never revert a transaction due to running out of funds.`

### PoC

This simple POC highlight that the `marketFunds` doesn't decrease with `withdrawDonation`
```javascript
    function testMarketFundsAccounting() public {
        uint256 profileId = 10;
        uint256 depositAmount = 1 ether;

        // Create market with initial liquidity
        vm.deal(user1, depositAmount);
        vm.startPrank(user1);
        market.createMarket{value: depositAmount}();
        vm.stopPrank();
        console.log("user1 address", user1);
        // User2 buys votes
        vm.deal(user2, depositAmount);
        vm.startPrank(user2);
        market.buyVotes{value: depositAmount}(profileId, true, 0, 500);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Check the accounting
        uint256 trackedFunds = market.marketFunds(profileId);
        uint256 actualBalance = address(market).balance;

        console.log("Tracked funds:", trackedFunds);
        // withdraw donation 
        vm.startPrank(user1);
        market.withdrawDonations();
        vm.stopPrank();
        uint256 BalanceAfter = address(market).balance;
        uint256 trackedFundsAferWithdrawingDonation = market.marketFunds(profileId);
        console.log("marketFunds after withdraw donation", trackedFundsAferWithdrawingDonation);
        assertEq(trackedFundsAferWithdrawingDonation, trackedFunds );
    }
```

### Mitigation

The simplest mitigation is to remove `donation` from `marketFunds`
```javascript
marketFunds[profileId] += (fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation);
```
