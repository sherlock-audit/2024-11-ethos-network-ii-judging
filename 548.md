# Lack of slippage protection during selling of votes will cause loss to the users

### Summary

ReputationMarket.sellVotes() doesnt have any slippage protection implemented and it can cause users to sell at lower prices that expected and cause loss to users, especially in highly volatile markets like markets with default configs

### Root Cause

```Solidity
function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // calculate the amount of votes to sell and the funds received
    (
      uint256 votesSold,
      uint256 fundsReceived,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);

    // update the market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;

    // apply protocol fees
    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

    // send the proceeds to the seller
    _sendEth(fundsReceived);
    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
    emit VotesSold(
      profileId,
      msg.sender,
      isPositive,
      votesSold,
      fundsReceived,
      block.timestamp,
      minVotePrice,
      maxVotePrice
    );
    _emitMarketUpdate(profileId);
  }
```

ReputationMarket.sellVotes() lacks any slippage protection and users votes will be sold at far lower prices than the user expects and cause fund loss to users. The default configured markets especially have highly volatile pricings and proper slippage protection is necessary .


### Attack Path

Suppose the user decides to sell 100 votes when the price is around 0.07ETH and before the particular sell transaction gets executed the price rapidly drops to 0.03 ETH , then the user will get far less than expected and will suffer loss

### Impact

Lack of any slippage protection causes users votes to be sold at far lower prices than the user expects and cause fund loss to users


### Mitigation

Implement a proper slippage protection similar to buyVotes():

```Solidity
function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 expectedAmount,
    uint256 slippageBasisPoints         
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant { 
```
