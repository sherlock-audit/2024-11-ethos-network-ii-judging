# Unfair fee calculation in the `ReputationMarket._calculateBuy()` function.

### Summary

When buying votes, the fee is deducted first, and the remaining amount is used to purchase votes. The final remaining amount is then refunded.

However, the fee should be calculated based on the actual amount used for the purchase.

### Root Cause

As shown in [line 960](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L960) of the `_calculateBuy()` function, the fee is deducted first, and the remaining amount, `fundsAvailable`, is used to purchase votes.

However, the `fundsAvailable` amount is not fully utilized for buying votes, which results in a discrepancy from the actual amount used for the purchase. Therefore, the fee calculation should be re-evaluated based on the actual amount used to buy votes.

```solidity
       function _calculateBuy(
         Market memory market,
         bool isPositive,
         uint256 funds
       )
         private
         view
         returns (
           uint256 votesBought,
           uint256 fundsPaid,
           uint256 newVotePrice,
           uint256 protocolFee,
           uint256 donation,
           uint256 minVotePrice,
           uint256 maxVotePrice
         )
       {
         uint256 fundsAvailable;
960:     (fundsAvailable, protocolFee, donation) = previewFees(funds, true);
         uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
     
         uint256 minPrice = votePrice;
         uint256 maxPrice;
     
         if (fundsAvailable < votePrice) {
           revert InsufficientFunds();
         }
     
         while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
           fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
           fundsPaid += votePrice;
           votesBought++;
     
           market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += 1;
           votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
         }
         fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;
     
         maxPrice = votePrice;
     
         return (votesBought, fundsPaid, votePrice, protocolFee, donation, minPrice, maxPrice);
       }
```

### Attack Path

Let's consider the following scenario:

Alice wants to buy some votes with `100` (the unit of currency is not important; we can assume it is 0.0001 ETH).

- The total fee percentage is `5%`, so `5` is deducted as a fee.
- Therefore, `95` is allocated to buy votes.
- However, only `76` is used because the price of the next vote exceeds `19`.
- As a result, `19` is refunded to the buyer.
- Finally:
    - Total Amount used: `76 + 5 = 81`
    - Fee paid: `5`

The actual fee percentage is calculated as `5 / 81 = 6.17%`, which exceeds the original `5%`.

In fact, if the buyer uses `80` instead of `100`, the outcome will remain the same, and the buyer will only incur a fee of `4` instead of `5`.

Of course, users can determine the required amount using the `simulateBuy()` function, but if someone makes a purchase earlier, a similar scenario could occur.

### Impact

Loss of funds for the buyer.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Recalculate fees after the purchase.
