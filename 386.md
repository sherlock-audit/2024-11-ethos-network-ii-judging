# Inconsistent Pause Implementation Allows Fund Locking During Emergency

### Summary

Users can deposit additional funds during contract emergency while withdrawals are blocked.
The increaseVouch function in EthosVouch lacks the whenNotPaused modifier while all other fund-related functions are properly protected. This allows users to unknowingly deposit additional funds during emergency situations when the contract is paused, while being unable to withdraw these funds until the contract is unpaused.


### Root Cause

In EthosVouch.sol, every critical function is protected by the whenNotPaused modifier except increaseVouch:
