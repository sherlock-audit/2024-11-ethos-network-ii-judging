# Admin Can Set Fees Up To 100% Affecting User Funds

### Summary

The choice to set `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` to 10000 basis points is a mistake as it allows admins to configure fees up to 100%, causing a potential loss of user funds as the protocol can charge excessive fees.

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120

The MAX_TOTAL_FEES constant is incorrectly set to 10000 basis points (100%) instead of 1000 basis points (10%):
`uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000; // Should be 1000`

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to configure the total fees to be exactly 10000 basis points.
2. The `checkFeeExceedsMaximum` function does not prevent setting fees beyond the intended 10%.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Admin sets `entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints`, `entryDonationFeeBasisPoints`, `entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints`, and `exitFeeBasisPoints` such that their sum equals 10000 basis points.
2. Users interact with the contract, expecting a maximum of 10% fees.
3. The contract deducts up to 100% in fees due to the misconfiguration.

### Impact

The users suffer an approximate loss of up to 100% of their staked amount due to excessive fees. The protocol gains these fees, which contradicts the intended business logic of a maximum 10% fee cap.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Change the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` to 1000 basis points to enforce a 10% maximum fee cap.
2. Ensure the `checkFeeExceedsMaximum` function correctly enforces this limit.
