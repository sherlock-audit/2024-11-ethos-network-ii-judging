# Incorrect checks make it possible for the vouch funds to be less than the configuredMinimumVouchAmount.

### Summary

A wrong check makes it possible for the guaranteed amount to be less than the configuredMinimumVouchAmount. Because after checking msg.value >= configuredMinimumVouchAmount, the protocol also charged a handling fee. The final amount of the voucher may be less than the configured minimum voucher amount.

### Root Cause

In [EthosVouch.sol#L380-L382](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L380-L382), the check is done before the fee and the vouch amount after the fee is collected may be less than the minimum.
