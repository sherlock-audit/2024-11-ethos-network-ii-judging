# Missing Checks in "_depositProtocolFee" function

# Audit Report for `_depositProtocolFee` Function

## Summary
The `_depositProtocolFee` function is intended to deposit the protocol fee into a specified address in the `EthosVouch.sol` file. However, it lacks checks to ensure that the contract has enough balance to cover the requested transfer. This missing check can lead to failures in transferring fees if the contract's balance is insufficient. 

- **File and Line Number:**  
  [EthosVouch.sol#L883](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L883)

### Example of Risk
The missing check in `_depositProtocolFee` will cause a failed transfer if the contract balance is less than the required `amount`, leading to a revert with no proper feedback to the caller.

---

## Root Cause
In the current implementation of the `_depositProtocolFee` function, no check is performed to verify that the contract has enough balance to cover the `amount`. This absence of validation can result in a failed transfer and the subsequent revert of the transaction.

- **Location of issue:**  
  `_depositProtocolFee(uint256 amount)` function in `EthosVouch.sol`.
- **Cause of the issue:**  
  The function attempts to send a fee without ensuring that the contract has the required balance, which can result in the transaction failing.

---

## Internal Pre-conditions
To ensure the safe execution of `_depositProtocolFee`, the following internal pre-conditions should be met:
1. Ensure the contract has sufficient balance to cover the requested fee amount.
2. Proper error handling should be added to detect and manage any cases of insufficient balance.

---

## External Pre-conditions
Although `_depositProtocolFee` is an internal function, it is essential that the caller ensures the contract has enough funds to process the fee deposit before invoking the function. Without this check, the contract could fail during execution, which is a risky design choice.

---

## Attack Path
If the `_depositProtocolFee` function is called without sufficient funds in the contract:
1. The function attempts to transfer the specified fee (`amount`) to `protocolFeeAddress`.
2. The transfer will fail, and the transaction will be reverted, with no feedback provided about the underlying issue.

---

## Impact
- **The protocol suffers a failed transaction due to insufficient funds.**  
  - The attacker or any user calling this function will face a failed transaction, leading to a potential denial of service or a wasted transaction attempt.
  - There is no feedback or fail-safe to handle this situation, which may cause confusion for users or attackers exploiting the lack of validation.

---

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
```solidity
contract ProtocolFeeTest {
    address protocolFeeAddress;

    function testProtocolFeeDeposit() external {
        uint256 amount = 1 ether;
        // Intentionally not ensuring the contract balance is sufficient
        _depositProtocolFee(amount); // This call will revert if balance < amount
    }

    function _depositProtocolFee(uint256 amount) internal {
        (bool success, ) = protocolFeeAddress.call{ value: amount }("");
        if (!success) revert("Protocol fee deposit failed");
    }
}
```
# Mitigation 

To mitigate the risks associated with the `_depositProtocolFee` function in the `EthosVouch.sol` file:

1. **Add a pre-check to ensure sufficient balance:**  
   Implement a pre-check within `_depositProtocolFee` to ensure the contract has enough balance to cover the transfer. This will prevent the transaction from failing due to insufficient funds.  
   
   Example code:  
```solidity
function _depositProtocolFee(uint256 amount) internal {
       require(address(this).balance >= amount, "Insufficient contract balance");
   (bool success, ) = protocolFeeAddress.call{ value: amount }("");
    if (!success) revert("Protocol fee deposit failed");
    }
```

2. **Document the Preconditions Explicitly:**
Document the preconditions clearly in the function's comments. This ensures developers are aware of the necessary conditions to call the function safely.
Example documentation:


```solidity
/**
 * @dev Transfers protocol fees to the specified address.
 * Preconditions: Ensure the contract has enough balance to transfer the `amount`.
 */
```
