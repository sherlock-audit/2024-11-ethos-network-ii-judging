# Incorrect assignment of `MAX_TOTAL_FEES`.

### Summary

The  `MAX_TOTAL_FEES`  has incorrectly assigned as 100% instead of 10%.

### Root Cause

According to the readme max total fee should be 10%.
>For both contracts:
> Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

It is expected that the maximum total fee for both contracts should be 10%. However, the `EthosVouch.sol` contract violates this assumption. 
And setting max total fee as 100% is irrelevant.

### Impact

Incorrect max total fee assignment.

+ uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000;
```
