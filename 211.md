# A single user can create any number of vouches and markUnhealthy in a loop without getting slashed

### Summary

A user can `vouch()` -> `unvouch()` -> `markUnhealthy()` any number of times. It will not be impacted by `slash()`.

### Root Cause

1. Method `vouch()` `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L369` checks `_vouchShouldNotExistFor()`  which will be true if the user `unvouch()` before. 

2. Method `unvouch()` `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L463` marks vouch as archived. Also, remove the entry from all the author -> profileId arrays and mappings.

3. Method `slash()` `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L534` skips archived vouches. So there is no impact on the attacker if it doesn't have any active vouches.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

A user can bombard with bulk unhealthy vouches by following `vouch()` -> `unvouch()` -> `markUnhealthy()`. 

Let's check the attack cost. The minimum amount to create a vouch is 0.0001 ether. Let's assume the total fees of all sort is 10%. The user gets 0.00009 ether on `unvouch()`. So each loop costs user 0.00001 ether. A total of 10000 unhealthy vouches will cost user 0.1 ether. Which is a very feasible attack.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Reevaluate the vouch flow. Don't allow user to create a vouch on profileId which it has marked as unhealthy previously.
