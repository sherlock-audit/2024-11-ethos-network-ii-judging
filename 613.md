# Missing an updating step for `isParticipant` in `sellVotes` will cause the mapping `isParticipant` can not be used for checking if a participant sold all their votes

### Summary

Missing an updating step for `isParticipant` in `sellVotes` will cause the mapping `isParticipant` can not be used for checking if a participant sold all their votes.

### Root Cause

In `ReputationMarket`, it is from the code comments that the mapping `isParitcipant` is used for checking if a participant sold all their votes

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L120

```solidity
  // profileId => participant address
  // append only; don't bother removing. Use isParticipant to check if they've sold all their votes.
```

However, the mapping `isParitcipant` is not set to false if a participant sold all their votes in `sellVotes`

```solidity
  function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // calculate the amount of votes to sell and the funds received
    (
      uint256 votesSold,
      uint256 fundsReceived,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);

    // update the market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;

>>  // If `votesOwned` is equal to zero, then `isParticipant` should be set false here

    // apply protocol fees
    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

    // send the proceeds to the seller
    _sendEth(fundsReceived);
    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
    emit VotesSold(
      profileId,
      msg.sender,
      isPositive,
      votesSold,
      fundsReceived,
      block.timestamp,
      minVotePrice,
      maxVotePrice
    );
    _emitMarketUpdate(profileId);
  }
```
