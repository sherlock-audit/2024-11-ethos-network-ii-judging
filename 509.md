# Buying votes for a given market using the `ReputationMarket.sol` contract takes a higher fee amount than it should

### Summary

The [`ReputationMarket:_calculateBuy()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L942) function applies fees on the total deposited amount rather than the total price of the votes, thereby costing the users more protocol fees.

### Root Cause

On [L960](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L960) the total sent eth (msg.value) is passed on to the [ReputationMarket:previewFees()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1141) function for the fees calculation, rather than the total price of the votes.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to set a none zero fee on the market

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The user pays more fees to the protocol due to incorrect fee calculations, the exact extra value paid will be dependent on factors such as how much eth the user has sent and how much the votes end up costing.

### PoC

append the following test lines to `test > reputationMarket > rep.fees.test.ts` inside of
```typescript
describe('Previewing Fees', () => {
    .
    .
    .
})
```

```typescript
it.only('incorrectly calculates entry fees', async () => {
      // Simulate the user buying votes without fees
      const { simulatedFundsPaid: noFeesPayment } = await userA.simulateBuy();

      // Set fees according to the test file's default values used
      await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints(entryFee);
      await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setDonationBasisPoints(donationFee);

      // Simulate the user buyng votes again, but this time with fees
      const { simulatedFundsPaid: withFeesPayment } = await userA.simulateBuy();

      // Calculate how much the fees would've been in the first simulate buy, using the same formula as the protocol
      const expectedProtocolFee = (noFeesPayment * BigInt(entryFee)) / BASIS_POINTS;
      const expectedDonation = (noFeesPayment * BigInt(donationFee)) / BASIS_POINTS;

      // Apply the expected fees
      const expectedFunds = noFeesPayment + expectedProtocolFee + expectedDonation;
      
      // Log how much more eth the user ended up having to pay
      console.log(ethers.formatEther((withFeesPayment - expectedFunds).toString()));
      
      expect(withFeesPayment).to.not.equal(expectedFunds);
});
```

### Mitigation

It's recommended to calculate the price of votes first before applying the fees on top of the price.
