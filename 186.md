# EthosVouch::updateUnhealthyResponsePeriod call from Admin could block vouch marking as unhealthy

### Summary

Lack of Minimum Check for unhealthyResponsePeriodDuration in EthosVouch::updateUnhealthyResponsePeriod Could Block Vouch Marking as Unhealthy

The `EthosVouch` contract provides safeguards for various admin functions, such as `setMinimumVouchAmount` and `updateMaximumVouches`, to prevent misconfigurations that could block core functionality. However, the `updateUnhealthyResponsePeriod` function lacks similar safeguards for its `unhealthyResponsePeriodDuration` parameter. Specifically, there is no minimum duration enforced, which could result in an invalid or excessively short duration being set.

### Root Cause

In [`EthosVouch::updateUnhealthyResponsePeriod::l.662`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L662)  lacks of minimum duration enforced.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The Admin calls `EthosVouch::updateUnhealthyResponsePeriod` with a value of 0.
2. The private function `_vouchShouldBePossibleUnhealthy` will evaluate `stillHasTime` as `false` due to the following logic:
```solidity
bool stillHasTime = block.timestamp <= v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt + unhealthyResponsePeriod;
```
3. Since the `stillHasTime` condition is always false, the function reverts with:
```solidity
revert CannotMarkVouchAsUnhealthy(vouchId);
```


### Impact

If the `unhealthyResponsePeriodDuration` is set to an extremely low value (e.g., 0), it effectively disables the ability to mark vouches as unhealthy. This would cause the private function `_vouchShouldBePossibleUnhealthy` to always fail the `stillHasTime` check, resulting in a revert whenever `markUnhealthy` is called. Consequently, the system's ability to manage and flag unhealthy vouches would be completely blocked.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To prevent this issue, introduce a constant to define an absolute minimum duration for `unhealthyResponsePeriod`. For example:

```solidity
uint256 private constant ABSOLUTE_MINIMUM_TIME_DURATION = 12 hours;
```

This ensures that the duration cannot be set below a reasonable threshold, maintaining the integrity of the unhealthy marking mechanism and preventing unintended functionality blocking.
