# Cross-contract reentrancy vulnerability in the Reputation Market

### Summary

The functions `buyVotes`,`sellVotes`and`_createMarket` don't respect the check effect interaction pattern which make them vulnerable to a cross-contract reentrancy with the graduate Market contract. 

### Root Cause

The three functions don't respect the CEI pattern
`_createMarket` :
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L347-L349
`buyVotes`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L478-L493
`sellVotes`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L520-L533
The `_sendEth`function send eth to the caller.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L891-L894
They are sending eth to the caller in order to refund the user but the `marketFunds` and `lastMarketUpdates` state variables are not set correctly since the sending happen before. The graduate market contract is not implemented yet but it is sure that it will read from those variable, moreover according to the protocol team participants of a market will have access to this smart contract. 

### Internal pre-conditions

none.

### External pre-conditions

none.

### Attack Path

1. A participants of a markets sell or buy votes.
2. The eth sending trigger a fallback function that exploit the graduate contract.

### Impact

The graduate contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack that could lead to a loss of funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The three functions should respect the CEI pattern.
