# Fees are also applied to the refund amount during the process of buying votes.

### Summary

- When a user wants to buy votes, they send ETH through msg.value. Votes are allocated based on the vote price, which is recalculated with each update. Any leftover ETH, insufficient to purchase a vote, is refunded to the user.
- Currently, there are two types of fees applied during the vote purchase: protocol fees and donation fees. These fees should be charged only on the amount actually used to buy votes, as that represents the effective purchase amount.
- However, in the protocol, fees are incorrectly applied to the entire msg.value sent by the user. 
- After deducting the fees, the remaining ETH is used to purchase votes, and any residual ETH, which cannot cover the cost of an additional vote, is refunded to the user.
This indicates that fees are being collected on the entire msg.value, including the portion of ETH that is later refunded to the user. This behavior is unintended and not as expected, as fees should only be applied to the amount actually used for purchasing votes.

### Attack Path

### Impact

Protocol fees and donation fees are also deducted from the refunded ETH amount during the buyVotes process, resulting in a loss for the buyer.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The protocol should ensure that both protocol fees and donation fees are collected only from the actual amount of ETH used to purchase votes.
