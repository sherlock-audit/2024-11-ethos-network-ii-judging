# Missing Utility to Withdraw Stuck Assets

## Summary
mart contracts interacting with EthosVouch or ReputationMarket may lack fallback or receive functions. When these contracts attempt to send ETH back, the transfer could fail, leading to assets being stuck.
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
Assets could become permanently stuck, leading to financial losses.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function _sendEth(uint256 amount) private {
    (bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{ value: amount }("");
    require(success, "ETH transfer failed");
  }
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a withdrawal function with access control (onlyOwner or onlyAdmin) to recover arbitrary asset amounts when stuck.
