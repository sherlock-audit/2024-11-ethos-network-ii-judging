# `DEFAULT_PRICE` is 10 times larger than intended, causing higher initial liquidity and prices

### Summary

The [`DEFAULT_PRICE`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L79) constant is incorrectly set to `0.01 ether`, which is 10 times larger than the intended value of `0.001 ether`. This results in the [`initialLiquidity`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L219-L254) for the first market configuration being set to `0.02 ether` instead of the intended `0.002 ETH`, leading to inflated initial market prices and liquidity. The other market configurations have the same issue.


### Root Cause

The `DEFAULT_PRICE` is used to calculate the `initialLiquidity` and other market parameters.

For example,  according to the comments, the intended `initialLiquidity` for the first market configuration is `0.002 ETH`. However, due to the incorrect `DEFAULT_PRICE`, the actual `initialLiquidity` becomes: `initialLiquidity = 2 * DEFAULT_PRICE = 2 * 0.01 ether = 0.02 ether`:

```solidity
79:>  uint256 public constant DEFAULT_PRICE = 0.01 ether;
...
219:     // Default tier
220:     // - Minimum viable liquidity for small/new markets
221:>    // - 0.002 ETH initial liquidity
222:     // - 1 vote each for trust/distrust (volatile price at low volume)
223:     marketConfigs.push(
224:       MarketConfig({
225:>        initialLiquidity: 2 * DEFAULT_PRICE,
226:         initialVotes: 1,
227:         basePrice: DEFAULT_PRICE
228:       })
229:     );
...
```



### Internal pre-conditions

The comments, for example, "0.002 ETH initial liquidity", is intended requirement.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This misconfiguration leads to markets being initialized with larger than expected prices.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the `DEFAULT_PRICE` to the intended value of `0.001 ether` to align with the documented "0.002 ETH initial liquidity" in the market configuration.
