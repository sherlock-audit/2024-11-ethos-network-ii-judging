# Unclaimed mock profiles are unable to claim rewards, causing vouchers to pay donation fees for no benefit

### Summary

The [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L673-L675) in `EthosVouch.sol` will prevent mock profiles from claiming their rewards. Therefore, vouchers will pay donation fees for nothing and the funds will be stuck in the contract.

### Root Cause

In `EthosVouch.sol:673`, a check ensures that mock profiles cannot claim their rewards, even though the protocol explicitly allows vouches for mocks.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `entryDonationFeeBasisPoints` needs to be greater than `0`.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls `EthosVouch::vouchByAddress()` or `EthosVouch::vouchByProfileId()` to vouch for a mock profile. The caller pays a donation fee, which should later be claimable by the mock.
2. The mock profile calls `EthosVouch::claimRewards()` to claim their rewards, but the call reverts.

### Impact

Mock profiles cannot claim their rewards, and the funds will be stuck in the contract. Furthermore, vouchers will pay a donation fee for nothing if they vouch for a mock profile, essentially donating the funds to the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider allowing mock profiles to call `EthosVouch::claimRewards()` to claim their rewards.
