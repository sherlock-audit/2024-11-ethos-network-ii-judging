# In `EthosVouch`, vouch may trigger a revert in case of `vouch -> unvouch -> vouch` process .

### Summary

In `EthosVouch.vouchExistsFor()`, to determine whether vouch exists, the following conditions need to be met:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L803-L811

The problem lies in the third condition:
```solidity
    v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt == 0;
```
When a vouch is unvouched, its `activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt` will be assigned a value:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L465

Which will cause the following situation where the transaction will revert:

1, Alice vouch Bob.
2, Alice unvouch Bob.
3, Alice vouch Bob again, it will cause a revert.

The reason for this is that `vouchByProfileId()` will call `_vouchShouldNotExistFor()`, and `_vouchShouldNotExistFor()` will in turn call `vouchExistsFor()`. Due to the previous unvouch operation, `v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt` is not empty, thus triggering a revert.
