# Wrong check related to `enforceCreationAllowList` in `createMarketWithConfig`

### Summary

- In `createMarketWithConfig` function, there is a if statement which is to make sure that sender can create a market or not. But this check is wrongly implemented.

```solidity
function createMarketWithConfig(uint256 marketConfigIndex) public payable whenNotPaused {
    uint256 senderProfileId = _getProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);
@>  if (enforceCreationAllowList && !creationAllowedProfileIds[senderProfileId]) {
      revert MarketCreationUnauthorized(
        MarketCreationErrorCode.PROFILE_NOT_AUTHORIZED,
        msg.sender,
        senderProfileId
      );
    }
    _createMarket(senderProfileId, msg.sender, marketConfigIndex);
  }
 ```
- When `enforceCreationAllowList` is set to true, only allowed profileIds can create the market and when it set to false anyone can create a market which is not correct.
