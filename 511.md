# An attacker can frontrun vouches to extract value from the `VouchersPool` fee

### Summary

The lack of protection against frontrunning in the `VouchersPool` reward distribution will cause a potential loss for previous voucher holders as an attacker can frontrun the first vouch for a profile to capture a disproportionate reward.

Importantly, this exploit does not necessarily require the attacker to monitor the mempool or perform precise frontrunning. By simply aiming to be the first voucher for multiple profiles—especially those likely to receive high vouch amounts—the attacker can increase the chances of profiting from the `VouchersPool` fee distribution. If the fees are sufficiently low, the attacker can profit by being the initial voucher for as many profiles as possible, even without specific knowledge of upcoming transactions. In essence, while frontrunning certain vouches guarantees profitability, the attack remains feasible and potentially profitable without explicit frontrunning capabilities.


### Root Cause

In the function [_rewardPreviousVouchers](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L697-L731), there is no protection against frontrunning for the first vouch of a profile, which allows an attacker to exploit the reward distribution by being the first to vouch when a profile has zero previous vouchers.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. The attacker must have a verified profile.


### External pre-conditions

1. The potential reward distribution must be large in enough to cover the fees incurred when vouching/unvouching


### Attack Path

1. The attacker monitors vouch calls to profile ids to find potential rewarding front-runs by capturing a portion (or the whole) `VouchersPool` fee. 
2. The legitimate voucher's transaction goes through and the attacker gets a share (or the whole if he's the only voucher) of the `VochersPool` fee.
3. The attacker calls unvouch to withdraw his funds from the contract and his profits are the initial vouch amount plus the `VouchersPool` fee minus the fees.


### Impact

The previous voucher holders suffer an approximate loss of their expected reward. The attacker gains a share of the reward by frontrunning the first vouch (and potentially later vouches if the `VouchersPoolFee` is big enough/the current vouch balance is small enough).


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

A possible mitigation would be to introduce a mechanism that limits the reward distribution for the first vouch or includes a time delay before distributing rewards, reducing the impact of frontrunning.
