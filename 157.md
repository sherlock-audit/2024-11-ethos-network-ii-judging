# Mapping isParticipant is not updated when user sells 100% of its votes of any profileId. Also getParticipantCount() doesn't factor users who sold all their votes

### Summary

In the summary of ***isParticipant***, it is mentioned that it is used to check if the user has sold all his votes. But this update is missing in `sellVotes()` method.

```solidity
  // append only; don't bother removing. Use isParticipant to check if they've sold all their votes.
  mapping(uint256 => address[]) public participants;
  // profileId => participant => isParticipant
  mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => bool)) public isParticipant;
  ```

Also, The method `getParticipantCount()` doesn't check if the underlying participant in the participants array has sold all his votes or not.

```solidity
  function getParticipantCount(uint256 profileId) public view returns (uint256) {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);
    return participants[profileId].length;
  }
```

### Root Cause

There is a missing handling in `sellVotes()`. Which should mark `isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender]=false` if the votesOwned by the msg.sender is 0.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

It breaks the assumption in the code that if the ***isParticipant*** mapping is true then the owner owns some of the votes of that ProfileId. It also corrupts `getParticipantCount()` response. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the following in `sellVotes()` method:
```solidity
if (votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[TRUST] + votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[DISTRUST] == 0) {
    isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = false;
}
```

In `getParticipantCount()` either remove the element from ***participants*** mapping array or iterate over the array and calculate elements where isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = true.
```solidity
function getParticipantCount(uint256 profileId) public view returns (uint256) {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);
    uint256 count = 0;
    for(uint i=0; i<participants[profileId].length; i++) {
      if(isParticipant[profileId][participants[profileId][i]]) {
          count++;
      }
    }
    return count;
  }
```
