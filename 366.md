# Fees in `EthosVouch` are taken incorrectly

### Summary
Upon vouching/ increasing a vouch/ unvouching, fees are applied. Currently, the following formula is used.

```solidity
  function calcFee(uint256 total, uint256 feeBasisPoints) internal pure returns (uint256 fee) {
    /*
     * Formula derivation:
     * 1. total = deposit + fee
     * 2. fee = deposit * (feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 3. total = deposit + deposit * (feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 4. total = deposit * (1 + feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 5. deposit = total / (1 + feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 6. fee = total - deposit
     * 7. fee = total - (total * 10000 / (10000 + feeBasisPoints))
     */
    return
      total -
      (total.mulDiv(BASIS_POINT_SCALE, (BASIS_POINT_SCALE + feeBasisPoints), Math.Rounding.Floor));
  }
```

However, that formula is flawed as it applies the fee on the `deposit` amount, instead of on the `total` amount.

### Root Cause

Wrong formula applied

### Attack Path
1. Fee is set to 5%
2. A user calls vouch with `msg.value` equal to 1 eth.
3. As the fee percentage is 5%, 0.05 eth should be taken.
4. Current formula however calculates it as `1e18 - (1e18 * 10_000 / (10_000 + 500)) = ~0.0476e18`
5. Protocol takes less fees than supposed to.

### Impact
Loss of funds for the protocol

### Mitigation
Calculate the fee based on the whole `total`.
