# Distributed donation rewards to the mock profile are locked in the contract

### Summary

In the `EthosVouch.vouchByProfileId` function, the mork profile receives donation rewards.
However, they can't claim rewards in the `EthosVouch.claimRewards` function.
As a result, this causes locking funds.

### Root Cause

In the `EthosVouch.claimRewards` function, the mock profile can't claim rewards from [L673](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/tree/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L673).

```solidity
L673:   if (!verified || mock) {
           revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(msg.sender);
        }
```

In the `vouchByProfileId` function, the mork profile receives donation rewards.

```solidity
L364:   if (archived || (!mock && !verified)) {
            revert InvalidEthosProfileForVouch(subjectProfileId);
        }
        [...]
L384:   (uint256 toDeposit, ) = applyFees(msg.value, true, subjectProfileId);
```
