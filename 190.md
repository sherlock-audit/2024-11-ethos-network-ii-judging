# The `EthosVouch.applyFees` function calculates the protocol, donation and vouchersPool fee incorrectly

### Summary

In the `EthosVouch.applyFees` function, it calculates the protocol, donation and vouchersPool fee individually using `fee = total - (total * 10000 / (10000 + feeBasisPoints))` formula.
This is the incorrect calculation of fees and causes the voucher's loss of funds. 

### Root Cause

In the [`EthosVouch.calcFee`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/tree/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L975) function, it calculates the fees using `fee = total - (total * 10000 / (10000 + feeBasisPoints))` formula.

```solidity
  function calcFee(uint256 total, uint256 feeBasisPoints) internal pure returns (uint256 fee) {
    return
      total -
      (total.mulDiv(BASIS_POINT_SCALE, (BASIS_POINT_SCALE + feeBasisPoints), Math.Rounding.Floor));
  }
```

In the [`EthosVouch.applyFees`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/tree/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L936-938) function, it calculates the protocol, donation and vouchersPool fee individually.

```solidity
      uint256 protocolFee = calcFee(amount, entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints);
      uint256 donationFee = calcFee(amount, entryDonationFeeBasisPoints);
      uint256 vouchersPoolFee = calcFee(amount, entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints);
```

This is the incorrect calculation of the fees and causes the users' loss of funds.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

1. None

### Attack Path

Let's consider the following scenario:

- entry protocol fee = 1%, donation = 2%, voucher pool = 3%: total fee = 6%
- If Alice tries to vouch 100 Eth, the protocol requires that she should pays 106 Eth.

```solidity
fee = total - (total * 10000 / (10000 + feeBasisPoints)) = 106 * 6 / 106 = 6 ether
```

However, if she pays 106 Eth, it calculates in the `applyFees` function as following:

```solidity
protocolFee = calcFee(amount, entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints) = 106 * 1 / 101 = 1.049;
donationFee = calcFee(amount, entryDonationFeeBasisPoints) = 106 * 2 / 101 = 2.099;
vouchersPoolFee = calcFee(amount, entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints) = 106 * 3 / 101 = 3.148;
totalFee = 1.049 + 2.099 + 3.148 = 6.296
```

As a result, Alice should pay 6.296 fee instead of 6 ether and she vouches 99.7 ether instead of 100 ether.
This is the Alice's loss of funds.

### Impact

Incorrect fee calculation causes the voucher's loss of funds.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

It is recommended to change the code in the `applyFees` function as following:

```diff
-      uint256 protocolFee = calcFee(amount, entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints);
-      uint256 donationFee = calcFee(amount, entryDonationFeeBasisPoints);
-      uint256 vouchersPoolFee = calcFee(amount, entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints);
+      uint256 totalFeeBasisPoints = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints + entryDonationFeeBasisPoints + entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints;
+      totalFees = calcFee(amount, totalFeeBasisPoints);
+      uint256 protocolFee = totalFees * entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints / totalFeeBasisPoints;
+      uint256 donationFee = totalFees * entryDonationFeeBasisPoints / totalFeeBasisPoints;
+      uint256 vouchersPoolFee = totalFees - protocolFee - donationFee;
```
