# Missing Slippage Protection When Selling Votes

## Summary
In ReputationMarket, users are protected against slippage when buying votes by specifying a minimum amount of votes to receive. However, no such slippage check exists when selling votes, which could lead to users receiving less than expected due to market manipulation.
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1003-L1007
Lacks a parameter to enforce the minimum refund amount when selling votes.
Attackers can front-run the transaction by manipulating market prices, reducing the refund amount.

## Impact
Without slippage protection, users may receive significantly less value when selling votes. This could discourage participation and result in financial losses.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function _calculateSell(
    Market memory market,
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  )
...
}
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a parameter in the selling function to enforce a minimum refund amount. Revert the transaction if the refund falls below this value to safeguard users from slippage.
