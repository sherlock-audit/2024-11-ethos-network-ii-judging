# vouching will happen successfully even when protocolFee is insufficient

### Summary

There's the following error that is never thrown: `InsufficientProtocolFeeBalance()` it is supposed to be used when reverting if protocol fees are insufficient when calling `applyFees(...)`.

### Root Cause

In `EthosVouch.sol:941` there's a missing check that should revert if protocol fees are insufficient.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. call `vouchByProfileId()` by passing msg.value in a way that makes protocolFee == 0, the function will not revert

### Impact

The protocol will allow users to vouch and increase vouch even when protocol fees are not sufficient.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
+  if (protocolFee == 0) {
           revert InsufficientProtocolFeeBalance();
    if (protocolFee > 0) {
            _depositProtocolFee(protocolFee); 
    }
```
