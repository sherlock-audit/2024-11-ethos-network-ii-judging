# Voucher Can Avoid `entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints` by Splitting Amounts Using `increaseVouch()` Function

### Summary

The `EthosVouch` contract allows vouchers to bypass a portion of the `entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints` by splitting their vouch amount into smaller increments using the `increaseVouch()` function. This behavior occurs because the `_rewardPreviousVouchers()` function incorrectly includes the current voucher in the fee distribution.


### Root Cause

- The `_rewardPreviousVouchers()` function distributes the `entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints` to all existing vouchers, including the current voucher being processed:

Therefore, a portion of vouchers' pool fee is distributed to the current voucher him/herself too.
- Exploiting this vulnerabiilty, by splitting a single vouch into smaller increments using the `increaseVouch()` function, the voucher can avoid a portion of the fees distributed to the pool.

### Attack Path

Assume that:
1. `entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints = entryDonationFeeBasisPoints = 0` and `entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints = 5000` (`50%`).
2. There is only one voucher `voucherA` who has vouched `6000` to the subject `subjectA`.
3. A voucher `voucherB` attempts to vouch `6000` to the subject `subjectA`.

Scenario 1: Single Deposit
1. `voucherB` vouches `6000` to `subjectA` at a time.
2. The vouchers' pool fee is `6000 * 50% = 3000` and all of them is distributed to `voucherA`.
3. `voucherA`'s balance is `6000 + 3000 = 9000` and `voucherB`'s balance = `6000 - 3000 = 3000`.

Scenario 2: Splitting the Deposit
1. Firstly, `voucherB` vouch `3000` to the subject `subjectA`.
    1. The vouchers' pool fee is `3000 * 50% = 1500` and all of them is distributed to the `voucherA`.
    2. Therefore, `voucherA`'s balance is `6000 + 1500 = 7500` and `voucherB`'s balance is `3000 - 1500 = 1500`.
2. Secondly, `voucherB` increase vouch amount `3000` to `subjectA`.
    1. The vouchers' pool fee is `3000 * 50% = 1500`.
    2. Since the total balance is `7500 + 1500 = 9000`, `1500 * 7500 / 9000 = 1250` is distributed to `subjectA` and `1500 * 1500 / 9000 = 250` is distributed to `subjectB`.
    3. Therefore, `voucherA`'s balance is `7500 + 1250 = 8750` and `voucherB`'s balance is `1500 + 250 + (3000 - 1500) = 3250`.

In the scenario 2, `voucherB` ends up with `3250` avoiding `250` in vouchers' pool fee than the case of scenario 1.


### Impact

Vouchers can avoid a portion of vouchers' pool fee by splitting their deposit into smaller increments. 
The smaller the splitted amounts, the greater the fee avoidance.


### PoC

### Mitigation

Modify the `_rewardPreviousVouchers()` function to exclude the current voucher from the fee distribution. For instance:
```diff
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalVouches; i++) {
      Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];
      // Only include active (not archived) vouches in the distribution
-     if (!vouch.archived) {
+     if (!vouch.archived && vouchIds[i] == currentVouchId) {
        totalBalance += vouch.balance;
      }
    }
```
Such a change ensures that the current voucher does not reclaim a portion of the fees meant for the pool, closing the exploit.
