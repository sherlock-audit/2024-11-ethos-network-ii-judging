# `EthosVouch` uses `ReentrancyGuard` instead of `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable`, creating incompatibility with upgradeability pattern

### Summary

`EthosVouch` inherits the following contracts:

[EthosVouch.sol#L67)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L67)
```javascript
contract EthosVouch is AccessControl, UUPSUpgradeable, ITargetStatus, ReentrancyGuard {
```

We can see that openzeppelin's [ReentrancyGuard](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol) is inherited instead of [ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.sol).

This is problematic, as `EthosVouch` follows the `UUPSUpgradeable` [proxy pattern](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L259).

Using `ReentrancyGuard` instead of `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` can lead to corrupt upgradeability such as storage collisions, as `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` is specifically designed to avoid this by ensuring there is no uninitialized states or misaligned storage.

### Root Cause

Using `ReentrancyGuard` instead of `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable`

## Internal pre-conditions

If admin decides to upgrade and add another storage slot, it can lead to storage corruption

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Corrupt upgradeability, storage collision/storage corrupted while upgrading

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Use [ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.sol) instead and call `__ReentrancyGuard_init()` when initializing
