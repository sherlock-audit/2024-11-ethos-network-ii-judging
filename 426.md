# `voucherPoolFee` can be sandwiched.

### Summary

`voucherPoolFee` is distributed based on the amount vouched(one having large amount get more reward), malicious user can sandwich this to take the large chuck of this reward.

### Root Cause

When someone `vouch` for the profile the `voucherPoolFee` is charged, this is is fee that is distributed among all the previous voucher for their commitment to the profile. According to the code the reward is distribute based on the vouched amount of the account. the one having more vouch amount receives more reward.

```solidity
 /**
   * @notice Distributes rewards to previous vouchers proportionally based on their current balance
   * @param amount The amount to distribute as rewards
   * @param subjectProfileId The profile ID whose vouchers will receive rewards
   */
   
function _rewardPreviousVouchers(
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 subjectProfileId
  ) internal returns (uint256 amountDistributed) {
    uint256[] storage vouchIds = vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId];
    uint256 totalVouches = vouchIds.length;

    // Calculate total balance of all active vouches
    uint256 totalBalance;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalVouches; i++) {
      Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];
      // Only include active (not archived) vouches in the distribution
      if (!vouch.archived) {
        totalBalance += vouch.balance;
      }
    }

    // If this is the first voucher, do not distribute rewards
    if (totalBalance == 0) {
      return totalBalance;
    }

    // Distribute rewards proportionally
    uint256 remainingRewards = amount;
    //@audit Sandwich the reward ?
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalVouches && remainingRewards > 0; i++) {
      Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];
      if (!vouch.archived) {
        // Calculate this vouch's share of the rewards
  ->>   uint256 reward = amount.mulDiv(vouch.balance, totalBalance, Math.Rounding.Floor);
        if (reward > 0) {
          vouch.balance += reward;
          remainingRewards -= reward;
        }
      }
    
```

The reward distribution based on amount makes the system vulnerable to sandwich attacks. A malicious user can monitor for incoming `vouch` transactions with large amounts and frontrun them by vouching first. When the large `vouch` transaction executes, the attacker will receive a significant portion of the voucherPoolReward. They can then unvouch and exit the system with a profit. 



### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

Malicious actors can get the reward without actually providing any value to the profile. 

### PoC

none

### Mitigation

Once the user `vouch` he shouldnâ€™t be allowed to unvouch immediately, There should be some time buffer between vouch and unvouch
