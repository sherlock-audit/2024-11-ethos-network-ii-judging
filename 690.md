# corrupt upgdreability pattarn

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

the `EthosVouch.sol` and `ReputationMarket.sol` are `UUPS upgradeable`,however the current implementation has multiple issue

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L67

The EthosVouch contracts are meant to be upgradeable. However, it inherits contracts that are not upgrade-safe.

 EthosVouch.sol and ReputationMarket.sol inherits the non-upgradeable version of ReentrancyGuard from Openzeppelin's library, when it should use the upgradeable version from [[openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable)](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable) lib.

The `AccessControl` and `SignatureControl` are both modified contracts from accessControl openzepplin contracts, both contain storage slots but there are no gaps implemented.



### Internal pre-conditions

If admin performs an upgrade and wants to add another storage slot , the storage slot would mess up.

### External pre-conditions

no response

### Attack Path

no response

### Impact

Storage of  contracts might be corrupted during upgrading.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Add gaps in AccessControl, SignatureControl
2. Use lOpenzeppelin-upgradeable reentrancyGuard instead
