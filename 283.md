# Fees on `buyVotes` are wrongly added in `marketFunds`

### Summary

- When user buys the votes by `buyVotes`, there are 2 types of fees - entry protocol fees and donation fees which are collected from the buy amounts.
- protocol fees are transferred to protocol fee address and donation fees are updated in donationEscrow of the profile id author (donationRecipient).
- There is variable called `fundsPaid` which is for total amount of fund used for buying votes. In `fundsPaid` protocol fees are donation fees both are added.

```solidity
function _calculateBuy(
    Market memory market,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 funds
  )
    private
    view
    returns (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      uint256 newVotePrice,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    )
  {
    ...
    if (fundsAvailable < votePrice) {
      revert InsufficientFunds();
    }
    while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
      fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
      fundsPaid += votePrice;
      votesBought++;
      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    }
@>  fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;
    ...
  }
 ```
- Now in `buyVotes` this variable called `fundsPaid` is added to the `marketFunds`. And market funds amount will be withdraw by the graduation withdrawal address after the graduation of the market.

```solidity
    // tally market funds
@>  marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
```
- This means both the fees are accounted 2 times and both fees will be collected by their actual holder and also by the graduation withdrawal address after the graduation of the market which is completely wrong and not expected. This is the loss for the contract.
