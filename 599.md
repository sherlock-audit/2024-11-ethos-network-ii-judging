# OverCalculation of marketFunds in buyVotes

### Summary

The `marketFunds` variable in the `buyVotes` function is incorrectly updated with the value of `fundsPaid`. In the `_calculateBuy` function, `fundsPaid` includes both the `protocolFee` and `donation`. These amounts are later distributed to other parties through `applyFees`, meaning they are not retained by the market. As a result, `marketFunds` is overestimated, which could lead to excessive withdrawals through `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` after the market graduates.

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket.sol:481](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481) the fundsPaid value is added to marketFunds. However, fundsPaid includes both protocolFee and donation, which are not part of marketFunds as they are transferred to the protocol and the subject's profile ID. This leads to an over-calculation of marketFunds.

### Attack Path

#### **Initial Setup**
1. A market is created with a specific `profileId`, and voting begins.
2. Multiple users participate in the market by calling the `buyVotes` function, providing funds to purchase votes.

---

#### **Execution**
1. **User A** buys votes by calling `buyVotes` with 100 Ether. The `_calculateBuy` function computes:
   - `votesBought`: The number of votes purchased.
   - `fundsPaid`: The total Ether used for the purchase, including `protocolFee` and `donation`.
   - `protocolFee` and `donation` are then distributed to their respective destinations via `applyFees`.
   - for example in this case 80 ether used for vote purchase and 20 ether used for fee and donation, it means balance of contract is added 80 ETH 
2. The `buyVotes` function incorrectly adds the entire `fundsPaid` (including `protocolFee` and `donation` 100 ETH in this case ) to `marketFunds`, overestimating the actual funds retained by the market ( actually there are 80 ETH in the market in this case ).
---

#### **Graduation and Withdrawal**
1. After the market ends, the market graduates, making `marketFunds` available for withdrawal via `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds`.
2. Authorized address calls `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds`, it withdraws amounts based on the inflated `marketFunds` value.
3. However, the underlying market does not have sufficient funds to match the marketFunds value (e.g., the market holds 80 ETH but attempts to transfer 100 ETH). As a result, the protocol is forced to cover the shortfall using funds from other markets.
4.  The contract does not have sufficient funds to cover all markets. Eventually, it runs out of funds at some point.

### Impact

Excessive withdrawals through `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` can lead to protocol insolvency, leaving the protocol without sufficient funds to cover all markets.
