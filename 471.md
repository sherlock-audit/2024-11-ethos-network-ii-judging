# There is a logic problem with _calcVotePrice, and the attacker has a way to make himself profitable forever.

### Summary

There is a logic problem with _calcVotePrice, and the attacker has a way to make himself profitable forever.
Specifically, the prices of TRUST and DISTRUST change in proportion to them. If the total amount of TRUST is greater, then the TRUST price will be higher. The sum of their two prices must be equal to basePrice.
Assume the following situation:
I'm a whale and when I participate in a market I only buy tokens priced below 1/2basePrice. Know to bring the price back to 1/2basePrice. This way, when the market ends, I will always be able to sell my tokens at 1/2basePrice. Thus I earned the difference. Even if there are fees, I can do this before the market closes and calculate whether I still have room for profit after subtracting the fees.
Letâ€™s give a simple example to illustrate this price difference:
Assume that the initial TRUST(T) and DISSTRUST(D) are both 1. A user buys 1 T, so T=2, D=1. Then the price of D at this time is 1/3basePrice. Eventually I was able to sell at 1/2basePrice. Even though the handling fee is as high as 10% basePrice. Then my arbitrage space also includes (1/2-1/3-1/10) basePrice.

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket.sol#L920-L923](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L920-L923), there is room for arbitrage in the price calculation model.

### Impact

1. This will benefit the attacker and cause losses to normal voting users.
2. This will make it impossible to achieve the original intention of the protocol design, that is, it will not be possible to use voting to judge whether an account is trustworthy. Seriously undermines the usability of the protocol.
