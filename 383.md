# `configuredMinimumVouchAmount` is checked before deducting fees.

### Summary
Within the protocol, there's a minimum vouch amount enforced. Users should not be able to create a vouch for less than that.

```solidity
    // must meet the minimum vouch amount
    if (msg.value < configuredMinimumVouchAmount) {
      revert MinimumVouchAmount(configuredMinimumVouchAmount);
    }

    (uint256 toDeposit, ) = applyFees(msg.value, true, subjectProfileId);
```

The problem is that the current implementation checks the amount, before deducting the fees. Therefore, it allows for creating vouches for less than the supposed minimum

### Root Cause

Wrong check

### Attack Path
1. There is enforced 0.1 eth `configuredMinimumVouchAmount ` 
2. User calls `vouchByProfileId` with `msg.value` 0.1eth
3. Check succeeds
4. Protocol deducts fees.
5. Vouch is made for less than the supposed minimum

### Impact
Creation of vouches for less than the minimum


### Mitigation
Put the check after fees are deducted.
