# increaseVouch reward the own vouch of the caller

### Summary

the increaseVouch function reward the own vouch of the caller if entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints is set. If the caller is the author of the heaviest vouch it could be unfair for the other vouchs.

### Root Cause

In the `increaseVouch:426`function the rewards will be distributed by the function `applyFees`at line 440 the function `_rewardPreviousVouchers`line 949 will distribute rewards amoung all the vouchs of the subject and the vouch that is currently increasing itself as we can see :

### Internal pre-conditions

1. entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints must be set.

### External pre-conditions

none.

### Attack Path

1. A user represent 90% of the totalVouch. 
2. If he increase his vouch he will have back 90% of the fees that he should paid to the vouchs making him avoiding paying a large part of the fees to the Vouchs.
3. He will avoid paying 90% of the fees he owes to other vouchs
4. reciprocally the other vouchs will pay him 90% of the reward fees.
### Impact

A part of the vouchs fees will not be paid if a user have a large part of the total vouch. Moreover a part of the rewards will not be paid by the user since he will be refunded. It's a loss of other vouchs authors.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The protocol should implement another function than applyFees for increaseVouch in order to avoid this issue.
