# Asymmetric slippage protection in vote trading creates price manipulation risk

### Summary

Lack of slippage protection in `ReputationMarket.sol::sellVotes` while present in `ReputationMarket.sol::buyVotes` will cause potential losses for sellers as:

1. Malicious actors can manipulate price through sandwich attacks or MEV
2. Even without malicious intent, users might suffer unexpected losses from normal market movements that occur between transaction submission and execution

### Root Cause

In `ReputationMarket.sol`, implementing slippage protection only for buying votes but not for selling is a mistake, as it creates inconsistent protection against price manipulation.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Market needs to exist with active trading volume.
2. No active paused state on the contract.
3. Price needs to be volatile enough to move significantly between transaction submission and execution (which could happen from normal trading activity or manipulation).

### External pre-conditions

For MEV scenario:
1. Base L2 network congestion needs to be sufficient to allow transaction reordering.
2. MEV infrastructure needs to be present on Base L2.

For market volatility scenario:
Normal market activity causing price changes during the period between transaction submission and inclusion.

### Attack Path

Scenario 1 (Malicious - MEV):

1. Attacker frontRuns with a large buy order, pushing up the price
2. Victim's sell transaction executes at manipulated price
3. Attacker backruns with sell order at higher price

Scenario 2 (Non-Malicious - Market Volatility):

1. User submits sell transaction at current market price
2. Natural market movements occur (other trades, changing supply/demand)
3. Transaction gets included at a significantly different price
4. User's trade executes at unexpected price with no ability to specify acceptable bounds

### Impact

The sellers suffer losses proportional to the price manipulation, while attackers profit from the price difference. While the practical risk is reduced due to deployment on Base L2 where MEV infrastructure is less developed, the inconsistency in protection between buy/sell functions suggests this is an oversight rather than intentional design. 

### PoC

The vulnerability is clearly demonstrated by the code inspection itself - we can directly see the asymmetric protection between buy and sell functions.

Presence of slippage protection in `ReputationMarket.sol::buyVotes`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L461

Absence of slippage protection in `ReputationMarket.sol::sellVotes`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L534

### Mitigation

Add slippage protection to sellVotes() similar to buyVotes():

```solidity
function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 slippageBasisPoints  // Add parameter
) public {
    ...
    _checkSlippageLimit(fundsReceived, expectedFunds, slippageBasisPoints);
    ...
}
```
