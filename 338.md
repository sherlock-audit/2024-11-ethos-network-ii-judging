# Incorrect value of `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` could lead to fee limit breaches

### Summary

According to [README.MD](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii?tab=readme-ov-file#q-are-there-any-limitations-on-values-set-by-admins-or-other-roles-in-the-codebase-including-restrictions-on-array-lengths), the sponsor stated that:
> Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%

Whenever one of fee is updated, it will be checked in advance to ensure that total fees can not exceed `MAX_TOTAL_FEES`:
```solidity
  function checkFeeExceedsMaximum(uint256 currentFee, uint256 newFee) internal view {
    uint256 totalFees = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints +
      exitFeeBasisPoints +
      entryDonationFeeBasisPoints +
      entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints +
      newFee -
      currentFee;
    if (totalFees > MAX_TOTAL_FEES) revert FeesExceedMaximum(totalFees, MAX_TOTAL_FEES);
  }
```
However, the value of `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is incorrect,  and the total fees can be up to `100%`:
```solidity
120:  uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
```
