# `marketfunds ` are wrongly updated in `buyVote` function

### Summary

When a user purchases votes using the buyVotes function, there are two types of fees involved: protocol entry fees and donation fees, both deducted from the purchase amount.

- Protocol fees are transferred to the designated protocol fee address.
- Donation fees are credited to the donationEscrow of the profile ID's author (referred to as the donationRecipient).
A variable named fundsPaid is used to track the total amount of funds spent on buying votes. This variable includes both the protocol fees and the donation fees
In the buyVotes function, the fundsPaid variable is added to marketFunds as shown below:
```solidity 
// Tally market funds
marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
```
This creates an issue: both protocol fees and donation fees are accounted for twice.

- Once when they are collected and transferred to their respective holders (protocol fee address and donation recipient).
- Again when marketFunds is increased, which is later withdrawn by the graduation withdrawal address after the market's graduation.

This double accounting is incorrect and unintended, resulting in a loss for the contract as two separate parties effectively collect the same fees.
