# User loses vouched amounts if address used to vouch is compromised

### Summary

The unvouch method for a profile id ~ author always takes the address that was used to vouch the subject address.
However if this address that belongs to the profile id gets compromised. The user will not be able to unvouch it with his existing addresses linked to his profile id, nor can he prevent the compromised address from taking the funds.

### Root Cause

The root cause is that the address used to unvouch isn't checked that its compromised from EthosProfile
