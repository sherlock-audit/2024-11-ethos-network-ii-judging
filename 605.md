# Incorrect price calculation when selling votes

### Summary

When selling votes the amount the seller receives is not the price at the moment of the sale, but rather the adjusted amount after the sale of the vote is taken into account.

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket.sol:1036](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1036-L1037) the amount of votes is decreased before calculating the price of the current vote. As a result the seller is credited with a lower amount than his vote was worth.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls [ReputationMarket::sellVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495)

### Impact

Let's assume we have an active market with the Default MarketConfiguration - 1 TRUST vote, 1 DISTRUST vote, 0.01 ETH  basePrice and the following scenario:

1. A user buys one TRUST vote and now the market has 2 TRUST, 1 DISTRUST votes resulting in 3 in total.
2. The user decides to sell his vote and the price should be calculated in the [_calcVotePrice()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L920) function the following way: 
```(1 * 0.01ETH)/3```
but instead we first decrement the vote count and get a different equation: 
```(1 * 0.01ETH)/2```

The price that the user receives for his vote is 3333333333333333wei instead of 5000000000000000wei ~ 0.0017ETH less!

### Mitigation

```diff
function _calculateSell(
    Market memory market,
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  )
    private
    view
    returns (
      uint256 votesSold,
      uint256 fundsReceived,
      uint256 newVotePrice,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    )
  {
    uint256 votesAvailable = votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST];

    if (votesAvailable < amount) {
      revert InsufficientVotesOwned(profileId, msg.sender);
    }

    uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);

    uint256 maxPrice = votePrice;
    uint256 minPrice;

    while (votesSold < amount) {
      if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
        revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
      }

-     market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
+     market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
      fundsReceived += votePrice;
      votesSold++;
    }
    (fundsReceived, protocolFee, ) = previewFees(fundsReceived, false);
    minPrice = votePrice;

    return (votesSold, fundsReceived, votePrice, protocolFee, minPrice, maxPrice);
  }
