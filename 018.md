# updateDonationRecipient can be ddosed

### Summary

updateDonationRecipient requires that newRecipient address doesn't have any rewards, but some users can add reward to it. 

### Root Cause
updateDonationRecipient requires  empty donationRecipient
```solidity
  function updateDonationRecipient(uint256 profileId, address newRecipient) public whenNotPaused {
    if (newRecipient == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();

    // if the new donation recipient has a balance, do not allow overwriting
    // this is so rare, do we really need a custom error?
-->    require(donationEscrow[newRecipient] == 0, "Donation recipient has balance");

    // Ensure the sender is the current donation recipient
    if (msg.sender != donationRecipient[profileId]) revert InvalidProfileId();

    // Ensure the new recipient has the same Ethos profileId
    uint256 recipientProfileId = _ethosProfileContract().verifiedProfileIdForAddress(newRecipient);
    if (recipientProfileId != profileId) revert InvalidProfileId();

    // Update the donation recipient reference
    donationRecipient[profileId] = newRecipient;
    // Swap the current donation balance to the new recipient
    donationEscrow[newRecipient] += donationEscrow[msg.sender];
    donationEscrow[msg.sender] = 0;
    emit DonationRecipientUpdated(profileId, msg.sender, newRecipient);
  }
```
but donationRecipient can be set arbitrary by anyone who can create market
```solidity
  function _createMarket(
    uint256 profileId,
    address recipient,
    uint256 marketConfigIndex
  ) private nonReentrant {
...
    donationRecipient[profileId] = recipient;
...
```
[contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L341](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L341)

and ddos it by buying 1 vote and sending fees to that address reward

```solidity
  function applyFees(
    uint256 protocolFee,
    uint256 donation,
    uint256 marketOwnerProfileId
  ) private returns (uint256 fees) {
->    donationEscrow[donationRecipient[marketOwnerProfileId]] += donation;
    if (protocolFee > 0) {
      (bool success, ) = protocolFeeAddress.call{ value: protocolFee }("");
      if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Protocol fee deposit failed");
    }
    fees = protocolFee + donation;
  }
```

user can withdraw it with `withdrawDonations` to make 0 but attacker can do the same again
### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

attacker sees that updateDonationRecipient called and buys 1 vote -> ddoes `updateDonationRecipient`
### Impact

updateDonationRecipient will be ddosed which lead to users will not be able to receive funds in case of emergency
### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
  function updateDonationRecipient(uint256 profileId, address newRecipient) public whenNotPaused {
    if (newRecipient == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();

    // if the new donation recipient has a balance, do not allow overwriting
    // this is so rare, do we really need a custom error?
-    require(donationEscrow[newRecipient] == 0, "Donation recipient has balance");
+    require(newRecipient != newRecipient, "Donation recipient has balance"); // @audit avoid doubling on the same address below attack

    // Ensure the sender is the current donation recipient
    if (msg.sender != donationRecipient[profileId]) revert InvalidProfileId();

    // Ensure the new recipient has the same Ethos profileId
    uint256 recipientProfileId = _ethosProfileContract().verifiedProfileIdForAddress(newRecipient);
    if (recipientProfileId != profileId) revert InvalidProfileId();

    // Update the donation recipient reference
    donationRecipient[profileId] = newRecipient;
    // Swap the current donation balance to the new recipient
    donationEscrow[newRecipient] += donationEscrow[msg.sender];
    donationEscrow[msg.sender] = 0;
    emit DonationRecipientUpdated(profileId, msg.sender, newRecipient);
  }
```
