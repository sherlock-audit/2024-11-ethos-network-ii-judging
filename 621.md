# Upgrades are prone to storage collision

### Summary

The EthosContracts suite (EthosVouch, ReputationMarket) implements UUPS upgradeability but requires storage layout enhancements for robust upgrades.

### Root Cause

Let's examine the current implementation:

```solidity
contract AccessControl {
    mapping(address => bool) public admins;  // slot 0
    mapping(address => bool) public operators; // slot 1
    // Missing storage gap
}
```


```solidity
contract SignatureControl {
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) public usedSignatures; // slot 0
    // Missing storage gap
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

Future upgrades could introduce storage conflicts. Example of unsafe upgrade:

```solidity
contract AccessControl {
    mapping(address => bool) public admins;     // slot 0
    mapping(address => bool) public operators;  // slot 1
    mapping(address => uint256) public roles;   // slot 2 - Conflicts with inherited contract storage
}
```


### External pre-conditions

No external conditions needed.

### Attack Path

Storage collision demonstration:

```solidity
function testStorageCollision() public {
    // Deploy V1
    EthosVouch v1 = new EthosVouch();
    
    // Upgrade to V2
    EthosVouch v2 = new EthosVouchV2();
    // Storage slots overlap here
}
```

### Impact

Storage corruption risks visualized:

```solidity
contract EthosVouch is UUPSUpgradeable, AccessControl, SignatureControl {
    // Inherited storage slots may overlap during upgrades
}
```

### Mitigation

Implement storage gaps:

```solidity
contract AccessControl {
    mapping(address => bool) public admins;
    mapping(address => bool) public operators;
    
    uint256[48] private __gap; // Reserve slots for future use
}
```


```solidity
contract SignatureControl {
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) public usedSignatures;
    
    uint256[49] private __gap; // Reserve slots for future use
}
```
