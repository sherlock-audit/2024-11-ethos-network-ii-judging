# Mock profile can't claim reward in edge case.

### Summary

Mock profile has mechanism to receive reward from vouch activity, and so, it should have right to claim reward. However, mock profile can't claim reward and should be verified to claim reward. However, in edge case where the mock profile can't be verified, the reward can't be claimed and locked forever.

### Root Cause

In the [EthosVouch.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L673) function, there is a check where only verified profile can claim the rewards.

Mock profile can be vouched and receive fee at that time. In the `EthosVouch.claimRewards()` function, only verified profile can vouch the reward. Therefore, mock profile should be verified to claim the rewards. But, in edge case where the mock profile can't be verified due to unavoidable circumstances, they can't claim reward and the reward will be locked forever.

```solidity
  function claimRewards() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    (bool verified, , bool mock, uint256 callerProfileId) = IEthosProfile(
      contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
    ).profileStatusByAddress(msg.sender);

    // Only check that this is a real profile (not mock) and was verified at some point
@>  if (!verified || mock) {
      revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(msg.sender);
    }

    uint256 amount = rewards[callerProfileId];
    if (amount == 0) revert InsufficientRewardsBalance();

    rewards[callerProfileId] = 0;
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: amount }("");
    if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Rewards claim failed");

    emit WithdrawnFromRewards(callerProfileId, amount);
  }
```

### Impact

Mock profile can't claim the rewards and the reward will be locked forever.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Implement same validation for subject profile in `EthosVouch.vouchByProfileId()`.
