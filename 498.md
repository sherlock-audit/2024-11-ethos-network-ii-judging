# Malicious validator can avoid slashing

### Summary

Regarding slashing, the [whitepaper](https://whitepaper.ethos.network/) states the following:

`"If a validator acts in bad faith, anyone who vouches them is able to pledge ETH to propose a slashing. If validators confirm unethical actions, slashing removes up to 10% of staked ETH from the offender's value locked in the Ethos contract."`

Once the slashing is confirmed, the designated slasher role calls the following function:

[EthosVouch.sol#L520-L555)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L520-L555)
```javascript
  function slash(
    uint256 authorProfileId,
    uint256 slashBasisPoints
  ) external onlySlasher whenNotPaused nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
    ...

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchIds.length; i++) {
      Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];
      // Only slash active vouches
@>    if (!vouch.archived) {
        uint256 slashAmount = vouch.balance.mulDiv(
          slashBasisPoints,
          BASIS_POINT_SCALE,
          Math.Rounding.Floor
        );
        if (slashAmount > 0) {
          vouch.balance -= slashAmount;
          totalSlashed += slashAmount;
        }
      }
    }

    ...
```

We can see that the slash only applies if the vouch is active (not archived).

A malicious validator can unvouch last second to avoid slashing and safely withdraw their funds:

[EthosVouch.sol#L452-L481](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L452-L481)
```javascript
  function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    ...

    v.archived = true;
    ...
  }
```

Depsite Base L2 being a private mempool, this can still be possible, for example a malicious sequencer can act in bad faith.

### Root Cause

Allowing immediate withdrawals despite the possibility of foreseeing slashing.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Avoid slashing, thus mitigating incentive for validators to act in good faith, breaking protocol invariant

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

When a user decides to unvouch, create a timelock mechanism where they must wait 24 hours before they can withdraw their funds, and change how `v.archived == true` is used to determine slashing.
