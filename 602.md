# The wrong increased amount of `marketFunds` in `buyVotes` will lead to withdrawal of a higher amount of ETH when calling `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds`

### Summary

The wrong increased amount of `marketFunds` in `buyVotes` will lead to withdrawal of a higher amount of ETH when calling `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds`withdrawal

### Root Cause

In `buyVotes`, the `marketFunds` is increased by `fundsPaid`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481

```solidity
  function buyVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 expectedVotes,
    uint256 slippageBasisPoints
  ) public payable whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // Determine how many votes can be bought with the funds provided
    (
      uint256 votesBought,
>>    uint256 fundsPaid,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);

    _checkSlippageLimit(votesBought, expectedVotes, slippageBasisPoints);

    ...

    // tally market funds
>>  marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
    ...
  }
```

The problem here is in the calculation of `_calculateBuy`, `fundsPaid` also includes `protocolFee` and `donation`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L978

This means an increased amount of `marketFunds` includes `protocolFee` and `donation`.

Since the `protocolFee` is credited to the protocol, and the `donation` is credited to the market creator, `marketFunds` will store an inflated amount of funds.

This wrong accounting of `marketFunds` will lead to the protocol withdrawing more than the amount of expected ETH when calling `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L675

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A market is created
2. Users buy votes via `buyVotes`
3. The market is graduated
4. The protocol calls `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds`

### Impact

- Loss of funds. The protocol will withdraw a higher amount of ETH when calling `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds`. This means the `ETH` from other markets is taken by the protocol.
- Insolvency. There would be not enough funds in the `ReputationMarket` for withdrawing from the last graduated market.

### PoC

1. Create `PoC.test.ts` in `test/reputationMarket`
2. Run `NODE_OPTIONS='--no-warnings=ExperimentalWarning --experimental-loader ts-node/esm/transpile-only' npx hardhat test test/reputationMarket/PoC.test.ts`

`PoC.test.ts`:

```solidity

import hre from 'hardhat';
import { loadFixture } from '@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox/network-helpers.js';
import { use } from 'chai';
import chaiAsPromised from 'chai-as-promised';
import { type ReputationMarket } from '../../typechain-types/index.js';
import { type EthosUser } from '../utils/ethosUser.js';
import { createDeployer, type EthosDeployer } from '../utils/deployEthos.js';
import { DEFAULT } from './utils.js';

/* eslint-disable react-hooks/rules-of-hooks */
use(chaiAsPromised as Chai.ChaiPlugin);
const { ethers } = hre;

describe('PoC', () => {
  let deployer: EthosDeployer;
  let marketUser : EthosUser, alice: EthosUser;
  let reputationMarket: ReputationMarket;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    deployer = await loadFixture(createDeployer);

    if (!deployer.reputationMarket.contract) {
      throw new Error('ReputationMarket contract not found');
    }
    [marketUser, alice] = await Promise.all([
      deployer.createUser(),
      deployer.createUser(),
    ]);
    await Promise.all([alice.setBalance('1')]);

    reputationMarket = deployer.reputationMarket.contract;
    DEFAULT.reputationMarket = reputationMarket;
    DEFAULT.profileId = marketUser.profileId;

    await reputationMarket
      .connect(deployer.ADMIN)
      .createMarketWithConfigAdmin(marketUser.signer.address, 0, {
        value: DEFAULT.initialLiquidity,
      });

    await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setProtocolFeeAddress(deployer.ADMIN.getAddress());
    await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints(100n);
  });

  it('PoC', async() => {
    console.log("Protocol Fee Basis Points: ", await reputationMarket.entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints());

    await reputationMarket.connect(alice.signer).buyVotes(DEFAULT.profileId, true, 1, 0, {value: ethers.parseUnits("0.006", "ether")});
    
    console.log("Contract's balance: ", await ethers.provider.getBalance(await reputationMarket.getAddress()));
    console.log("marketFunds[profileId]: ", await reputationMarket.marketFunds(DEFAULT.profileId));
  })
});
```

Logs

```bash
Protocol Fee Basis Points:  100n
Contract's balance:  25000000000000000n
marketFunds[profileId]:  25060000000000000n
```

The value `marketFunds[profileId]` is larger than the contract's balance.

If the market is graduated, and the protocol withdraws the market funds from the contract, then there would be not enough ETH in the contract to withdraw.

### Mitigation

Exclude `protocolFee` and `donation` when increasing `marketFunds` in `buyVotes`

```solidity
  function buyVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 expectedVotes,
    uint256 slippageBasisPoints
  ) public payable whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // Determine how many votes can be bought with the funds provided
    (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);
    ...
    // tally market funds
-   marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
+   marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation;
    ...
  }
```
