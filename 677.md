# User loses more deposit value because of incorrect fee calculation

### Summary

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L936-L938

The fee calculation is done differently causing cascaded fees to be calculated wrongly causing loss of funds for the User. The User pays a bigger percentage of the amount to fees instead of the `toDeposit` value

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L988

In `calcFee` we see that the amount to be taken as fees is taken as 
`fee = total - (total * 10000 / (10000 + feeBasisPoints))`

Also initially 
` fee = deposit * (feeBasisPoints/10000)`

So, here we notice that the fee calculation is always done as a percentage of the deposit. It assumes the User has a constant deposit upon whose value the total is used to calculate the fee.

The problem begins when we cascade the fees like [this](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L951-L952)

The end result is that the calculation is wrong and way more expected fees is taken from the User's deposit value.

### Impact

The user loses more of the deposit value to fees instead of the balance. The incorrect fee calculation would be much more pronounced if the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` limit was a higher percentage.

### PoC


**example:**

amount ~ 1e14
lets assume all three percentages are about 3% ~ 300 basis points.
total ~ 1e14 (0.0001 ether)
the calculation for one fee would be
-> 1e14 - (1e14)*10_000/(10_000 + 300)
= 2912621359224 ~ 
2.91e+12
The deposit value used in the calculation would be 9.71e+13 (total - fees) (1e14 - 2.91e+12)

Here is where the sum of fees is directly subtracted from the total amount. This is a mistake because it changes the deposit value of the user used in calculation to the one stored in the protocol.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L951-L952

The value would be 
(We assume all three values are 3% ~ 300 basis points.
1e14 - (2.91e+12 + 2.91e+12 + 2.91e+12)

The end value would be 9.13e+13 however the deposit value used in the calculation was 9.71e+13 !!
This difference causes more than expected funds from the user to be used for fees causing loss of funds.

Here the 3%, 3%, 3% fees of the deposit amount should amount to about 9% of the deposited value.

However we see that the percentage of deposit amount used was ~ ((2.91e+12)*3/ 9.13e+13)*100
~ 9.561% and about (2.91e+12/9.13e+13) ~ 3.18 percentage instead of the 3% because of wrong calculation.

While the percentage is supposed to be 9% and 3%

`total Amount : `  1e14  ~ 100% of deposited total amount
`total fees : `  '8.73e+12'  ~ 8.73% of deposited total amount
`total deposit  : `  '9.13e+13'  ~ 91.3% of deposited total amount

`fees as percentage of deposit : ` ~ 9.56%
_________________________________________________________________________
**Arithemetic impact**
The numbers look small only because of the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` limit of 10%, if supposedly the MAX_TOTAL_FEES was about 90%
the loss would be MUCH higher

lets take the split of 30% for each fee value

-> 1e14 - (1e14)*10_000/(10_000 + 3000)
= 23076923076924.0~ 
'2.31e+13'
The deposit value used in the calculation would be 7.69e+13

The `toDeposit` value would be 1e14 - (2.31e+13 + 2.31e+13 + 2.31e+13)
'3.07e+13'.

The percentage used instead of the 30% for a single fee calculation would be 2.31e+13/3.07e+13 ~ 75%

We can see that instead of the 90% of value it was supposed to take, it took (2.31e+13 + 2.31e+13 + 2.31e+13)/3.07e+13
it took 225% and instead of the 30% value it had to take from the deposited amount.

It took 2.31e+13/3.07e+13 
`75% of the value.`

In this case the mathematical error will be way more pronounced.

`total Amount : `  1e14  ~ 100% of deposited total amount
`total fees : `  '6.93e+13'  ~ 69.3% of deposited total amount
`total deposit  : `  '3.07e+13'  ~ 30.7% of deposited total amount

`fees as percentage of deposit : ` ~ 225%

We can clearly see that the impact becomes much bigger and the fees becomes greater than the deposit value itself. The `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` as a bigger value is shown purely for the mathematical impact while `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` having lesser value does minimize the impact.

### Mitigation

The mitigation is to add up the fee percentage values and then pass it to the `calcFee` method, and then subtract it from the total amount.

**Example**
3%, 3%, 3% fees protocolFee, donationFee, vouchersPoolFee
amount ~ 1e14
add up percentages : 300 + 300 + 300 ~ 900
then pass to `calcFee`
1e14 - 1e14*1e4/(1e4+900)
`fees value of ` : 8.26e+12
toDeposit value would become 1e14 - 8.26e+12 --> 91740000000000 , '9.17e+13'

The fee percentage would be 8.26e+12/9.17e+13 = 9%

**higher allowed fee percentage Example**
Similarly for the mathematic case of 
30%, 30%, 30% fees protocolFee, donationFee, vouchersPoolFee
add up percentages :  3000 + 3000 + 3000 ~ 9000

pass to `calcFee`
1e14 - 1e14*1e4/(1e4+9000)
fees = '4.74e+13'
`toDeposit` value = '5.26e+13'

The fee percentage would be 4.74e+13/5.26e+13 = 90%

This would cause lower calculations and be accurate
