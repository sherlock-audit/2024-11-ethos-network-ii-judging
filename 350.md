# The `ReputationMarket.sellVotes` function does not have slippage check like `buyVotes` function

### Summary

In the [`ReputationMarket.sellVotes`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/tree/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495) function, there is no slippage check like `buyVotes` function.
The vote price is variable according to the trust and distrust votes count.
As a result, the `buyVotes` function checks for slippage, and the `sellVotes` function should do so as well.

### Root Cause

In the `ReputationMarket.sellVotes`, there is no slippage check.

```solidity
  function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
```

The `sellVotes` function should check slippage like in the `ReputationMarket.buyVotes` function.

```solidity
  function buyVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 expectedVotes,
    uint256 slippageBasisPoints
  ) public payable whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### Impact

### PoC

### Mitigation
