# Malicious attackers can steal funds by buying and selling votes in one transaction from the reputation market

### Summary

Users can buy on sell votes in one transaction and the vote price is changed according the voting count.
Using this vulnerability, malicious attackers can steal funds from the market.

### Root Cause

The `buyVotes` and `sellVotes` function does not check whether they are called in one transaction.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/tree/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442-L534

```solidity
  function buyVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 expectedVotes,
    uint256 slippageBasisPoints
  ) public payable whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant

  function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant
```

Users can change the vote price by calling these functions in one transaction to steal funds.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

- There is the market with `0.01 ether` as initial liquidity.
- For the simplicity, ignore the protocol and donation fees.
- Alice buys and sells votes in one transaction:
  - buy 1 trust vote: pay basePrice * 1 / 2
  - buy 1 distrust vote: pay basePrice * 1 / 3
  - buy 1 trust vote: pay basePrice * 1 / 2
  - sell 1 distrust vote: receive basePrice * 1 / 4
  - sell 1 trust vote: receive basePrice * 2 / 3
  - sell 1 trust vote: receive basePrice * 1 / 2

As a result, Alice receives `basePrice * 1 / 12` ethers additionally.

Alice can also steal funds using this vulnerability in general status of the market, not only in scenario.

### Impact

Malicious attackers can steal funds of the market.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Improve the vote price calculation mechanism or restrict users not to buy and sell votes in one transaction
