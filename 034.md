# ProtocolFee for selling in `ReputationalMarket` should be deducted from the buyer's proceeds received, not from the balance of the protocol

### Summary

Let's consider the function [`sellVotes`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495).
```solidity
function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // calculate the amount of votes to sell and the funds received
    (
      uint256 votesSold,
      uint256 fundsReceived,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);

    // update the market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;

    // apply protocol fees
    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

    // send the proceeds to the seller
    _sendEth(fundsReceived);
    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
    emit VotesSold(
      profileId,
      msg.sender,
      isPositive,
      votesSold,
      fundsReceived,
      block.timestamp,
      minVotePrice,
      maxVotePrice
    );
    _emitMarketUpdate(profileId);
  }
```

Let's consider the function `sellVotes`.

This function has two variables that are responsible for the number of ether.
`fundsReceived` - the amount for which all votes are sold. The protocol sends this amount to the seller.

`protocolFee` - protocol commission from the sale. It goes to `protocolFeeAddress`.

However, protocolFee must be subtracted from fundsReceived, otherwise it violates the counting of all funds on the contract, namely there is a miscalculation between marketFunds and the actual amount of eth on the contract.

Let's look at an example.
Let there be 200 eth on the contract. MarketFunds = 200. User sells votes for 100 ETH (fundsReceived = 100ETH. ProtocolFee = 5 ETH.).

Thus, after the function is executed, marketFunds = 200 - fundsReceived = 100. However, there will be only 95 on the contract. Since 100 will go to the buyer and 5 to the protocolFeeAddress.

Thus, after this, calling the `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` function will DOS due to lack of funds.

### Root Cause

ProtocolFee should be subtracted from fundsReceived. Roughly speaking - the user should pay the commission, not the protocol.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- DoS functions withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds.
- protocol loses commissions (loss of funds)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

`fundsReceived -= protocolFee`
