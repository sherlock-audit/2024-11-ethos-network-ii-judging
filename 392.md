# No Slippage protection while Selling Votes

### Summary

Users selling votes have no protection against price slippage, which could result in receiving significantly less ETH than expected when market conditions change between transaction submission and execution. There is also no deadline parameter which is also a issue up here.

### Root Cause

the `sellVotes()` function lacks similar protection:
```solidity
function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    // No slippage protection parameters or checks
    // ...
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

**Frontrunning**
 Malicious actors can monitor the mempool for sellVotes transactions
Upon seeing a large sell order, they can:
- Frontrun by selling their own votes first
- This drives down the vote price due to the bonding curve mechanism
- The original user's transaction executes at the lower price
- The attacker effectively extracts value from the legitimate seller

**Sandwitch**
- Attacker sees victim's sellVotes transaction in mempool 
-  FRONT-RUN: Attacker sells their votes first, driving price down
- VICTIM: Victim's sellVotes executes at lower price 
- BACK-RUN: Attacker buys back votes at depressed price



### Impact

Without slippage protection, users have no way to specify a minimum acceptable price for their sell orders. This could lead to significant losses especially in volatile market conditions or when faced with MEV sandwich attacks.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```solidity
function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 minFundsExpected,
    uint256 slippageBasisPoints
) public {
    // ... existing code ...
    
    if (fundsReceived < minFundsExpected) {
        revert SlippageLimitExceeded(fundsReceived, minFundsExpected, slippageBasisPoints);
    }
    
    // ... rest of function
}
```
