# Compromised Address Permanently Traps Staked Funds, Exposing Users to Complete Financial Loss

### Summary

In `EthosVouch` contract the requirement for `msg.sender` to match the `authorAddress` in the `unvouch` function will cause an inability to recover staked funds for the user , in case the address gets compromised , as the user cannot use a different address to call the function.

### Root Cause

In the`unvouch` function the requirement that `msg.sender` must equal `authorAddress` ` (vouches[vouchId].authorAddress != msg.sender) ` prevents users from recovering funds if their vouching address is marked as compromised.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. A user creates a `vouch` using `address A`.
2. The `address A` is later `compromised` and marked as such in 'Ethos.profile'.
4. The user attempts to call the `unvouch` function using a new secure address, but the function reverts due to the `msg.sender` check.
5. **The user's staked funds remain locked, with no way to recover them.**

### Impact

user's staked funds gets locked forever in the protocol and no way to recover it.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow users to withdraw from other addresses that is associated with the same `profileID`.
Introduce a recovery mechanism allowing users to transfer the ability to unvouch to a new address after marking the original address as compromised
