# Incorrect `marketsFunds` states update while `buyVotes()`, cause market funds to be stuck on graduation

### Summary

The `marketsFunds[]` contract state tracks the current invested funds in the market. These funds can only be withdrawn upon graduation. However, due to [incorrect accounting](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481) in `marketFunds` while buying votes, the graduation process will not work. Consequently, the funds cannot be withdrawn. 

### Root Cause
Generally, when user `buyVotes()`, they pays a `protocolFee` and `donation` amount, along the amount with which votes have been bought, if excess eth is sent, it trasnfer back to the buyer. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442

Among fees, the `protocolFee` is immediately taken out, and other side internal accounting for donation amount has been kept track in `donationEscrow`

```solidity
  function applyFees(
    uint256 protocolFee,
    uint256 donation,
    uint256 marketOwnerProfileId
  ) private returns (uint256 fees) {
    donationEscrow[donationRecipient[marketOwnerProfileId]] += donation;
    if (protocolFee > 0) {
      (bool success, ) = protocolFeeAddress.call{ value: protocolFee }("");
      if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Protocol fee deposit failed");
    }
    fees = protocolFee + donation;
  }
```

which is withdrawable anytime via [`withdrawDonations()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L570)

and after further accounting, the `marketFunds[profileId]` has been updated with `fundsPaid`. The issue here is that the `fundsPaid` amount includes the `protocolFee` and `donation`, which, as we already know, are processed above.

As a result, the marketFunds value for that profile is overstated, and during graduation, it reverts because it attempts to withdraw more than it should.

```solidity
  function withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(uint256 profileId) public whenNotPaused {
...snip...
    _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]);         >>> @audit  transfer eth fails
    emit MarketFundsWithdrawn(profileId, msg.sender, marketFunds[profileId]);
    marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
  }
```
### Attack Path
1. A new market is created with `50 ether` as initialLiquidity, so `marketFunds[1]==50 ether`
2. Alice `buyVotes` with `100 ether`, on which a total 10% fee(protocolFee + donation) is charged, the `5 ether` is immediately transferred and rest `5 ether` is cached in internal state, consider which is also withdrawn later
3. The `marketFunds[1]` state updates to `150 ether`, where in actual there is only `140 ether` as balance. Note that, with each `buyVotes()`, the `marketFunds[1]` value get more inflated
4. When it graduates, and `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()` get called, the txn will revert. 
### Impact
Permanent locking of funds

### Mitigation
```diff
  function buyVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 expectedVotes,
    uint256 slippageBasisPoints
  ) public payable whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
...snip...
    // Calculate and refund remaining funds
    uint256 refund = msg.value - fundsPaid;
    if (refund > 0) _sendEth(refund);

    // tally market funds
-   marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
+   marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation;
```
