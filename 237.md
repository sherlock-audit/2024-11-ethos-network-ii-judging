# Incorrect Vote Price Calculation in Sell Transaction

## Summary
The current implementation of the `_calculateSell` function mechanism calculates the received funds based on the vote price after the vote is subtracted, leading to a potentially incorrect representation of the funds received for each vote sold.

## code snippet:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1026-L1040

## Vulnerability Details
Current Implementation:
```solidity
while (votesSold < amount) {
      if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) { 
        revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
      }

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
      fundsReceived += votePrice;
      votesSold++;
}
```
#### Key Issue:
1. The `votePrice` is calculated after subtracting the vote
2. This means `fundsReceived` reflects the price of the next vote, not the current vote being sold
3. Creates a misalignment between the actual vote being sold and its calculated price

## Impact
1. Pricing Inaccuracy: Funds received do not accurately represent the price of votes being sold
2. Potential Financial Discrepancy: Users may receive different funds than expected

## Recommended
Modify the implementation to `fundsReceived += votePrice;`  before subtracting the vote:
```solidity
   uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);

    uint256 maxPrice = votePrice;
    uint256 minPrice;

    while (votesSold < amount) {
      if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
        revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
      }

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
      fundsReceived += votePrice;
      votesSold++;
    }
```
