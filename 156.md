# Incorrect calculation of fees in `EthosVouch` leading to unfair fee distribution and deposit

### Summary

`EthosVouch` apply fees like how tax is done, as devs have explained, if the to-be-deposit amount is 100, and total fee rate is 7%, the final amount user would need to provide is 107, which is 100 + 100 * 7%. However, the actual calculation is faulty, user can deposit more than supposed, and protocol will get less fees than expected.

### Root Cause

[Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L975C1-L989C4) is how the contract calculates fee:
```solidity
  function calcFee(uint256 total, uint256 feeBasisPoints) internal pure returns (uint256 fee) {
    /*
     * Formula derivation:
     * 1. total = deposit + fee
     * 2. fee = deposit * (feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 3. total = deposit + deposit * (feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 4. total = deposit * (1 + feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 5. deposit = total / (1 + feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 6. fee = total - deposit
     * 7. fee = total - (total * 10000 / (10000 + feeBasisPoints))
     */
    return
      total -
      (total.mulDiv(BASIS_POINT_SCALE, (BASIS_POINT_SCALE + feeBasisPoints), Math.Rounding.Floor));
  }
```

The calculation checks out, but the issue is how it's used. `applyFees` is used to apply all fees with given amount:
```solidity
function applyFees(
    uint256 amount,
    bool isEntry,
    uint256 subjectProfileId
  ) internal returns (uint256 toDeposit, uint256 totalFees) {
    if (isEntry) {
      // Calculate entry fees
      uint256 protocolFee = calcFee(amount, entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints);
      uint256 donationFee = calcFee(amount, entryDonationFeeBasisPoints);
      uint256 vouchersPoolFee = calcFee(amount, entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints);

```

As we can see, the calculation is done with each separate fee, instead of all fees in total. This brings a problem, because the way current calculation would calculate less fees than expected, and the deposit amount would be higher. For example, if we use the numbers from the summary section, to deposit 100 wei, with total fees being 7%, in total user would need to supply 107 wei, and the vouch balance will also be 100 wei, this is because user deposited 100 wei. Follow the logic and create a PoC to vouch 0.0107 ETH, and setting total fees to 700, which is 7%, it would bring the actual vouch balance to 0.0103 ETH. Detailed PoC suite will be included below.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Protocol fee is 100 (1%), donation fee is 200 (2%), and pool fee is 400 (4%), making the total fee be 700, which is 7%.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Less fees are collected by all relevant parties, and user would deposit more amount than expected.

### PoC

Below is added to the `EthosVouch.test.ts` file:
```typescript
            it('fee distribution check', async () => {
                const {
                    ethosVouch,
                    PROFILE_CREATOR_0,
                    PROFILE_CREATOR_1,
                    VOUCHER_0,
                    VOUCHER_1,
                    ethosProfile,
                    OWNER,
                    ADMIN
                } = await loadFixture(deployFixture);

                // create a profile
                await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(VOUCHER_0.address);
                await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address);
                await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(PROFILE_CREATOR_1.address);
                await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(VOUCHER_1.address);
                await ethosProfile.connect(VOUCHER_0).createProfile(1);
                await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).createProfile(1);
                await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_1).createProfile(1);
                await ethosProfile.connect(VOUCHER_1).createProfile(1);

                await ethosVouch.connect(ADMIN).setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints(100);
                await ethosVouch.connect(ADMIN).setEntryDonationFeeBasisPoints(200);
                await ethosVouch.connect(ADMIN).setEntryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints(400);

                console.log('protocol fee %:', await ethosVouch.entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints());
                console.log('donation fee %:', await ethosVouch.entryDonationFeeBasisPoints());
                console.log('pool fee %:', await ethosVouch.entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints());


                // 0
                await ethosVouch.connect(VOUCHER_0).vouchByProfileId(3, DEFAULT_COMMENT, DEFAULT_METADATA, {
                    value: ethers.parseEther('0.0107'),
                });

                console.log('vouch balance:', ((await ethosVouch.vouches(0))["6"]));

            })
```

The logic is simple, set fees as admin, and vouch to any profile with expected 0.0107 ETH of asset, which if the calculation is correct, vouch balance will be 0.01 ETH. Here is the console output:
```text
protocol fee %: 100n
donation fee %: 200n
pool fee %: 400n
vouch balance: 10384255484371966n
        âœ” fee distribution check
```

If we normalize 10384255484371966 wei, which is 0.01038425548437196 ETH, around 3% higher than expected.

### Mitigation

The simple way of fixing would be let user provide a number, and calculate total fund needed, revert if not enough, refund is there is excessive. Another way of doing it, which is to keep the current calculation, but instead applying it on fees separately, do it as a whole, which is to say:
```text
toDeposit, totalFee = applyFees(funds, true, totalFeePoints);
protocolFee = toDeposit * protocolFeePoints / BasisPoint
....
```

The above snippet is pseudo code, only to show the general idea.
