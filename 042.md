Cheery Mustard Swallow

High

# `EthosVouch` has an incorrect Max fee configuration, total fees are to not be more than 10% but the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is set at 100%, making it possible to charge users higher than expected in fees.

### Summary

There is a critical discrepancy between the protocol's documentation regarding Max Total Fees, and the actual implementation of maximum total fees in the smart contract, as the readme clearly states **_"For both contracts: Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%"_** However, the code permits fees up to 100%, which deviates from the stated intention. When Admin sets the various fee, there is potential to go higher than expected as the `checkFeeExceedsMaximum` will not limit total fees to 10% as was intended, potentially deducting up to 100% in vouch fees if admin was not careful enough with the parameter values of the various fees charged. This oversight creates a significant risk where users could be charged fees far beyond their expectations, leading to the possibility of total loss of funds.

### Root Cause

In `EthosVouch.sol:120`, MAX_TOTAL_FEES is set to 10 000 instead of 1000.

```solidity
  uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
```

### Attack Path

1. When Admin sets the various fee, there is potential to go higher than expected as the `checkFeeExceedsMaximum` will not limit total fees at 10%, potentially deducting up to 100% in user fees if admin was not careful enough.
2. User A vouches for User B.
3. Due to the incorrectly set MAX_TOTAL_FEES, User A is subjected to an unexpectedly high fee.
4. This fee could reach up to 100%, causing User A to lose their entire staked amount.

### Impact

1. Unintended Loss of Funds:
Users may lose their entire stake due to fees being set up to 100%.
2. Breach of User Expectations:
Users expect a maximum fee of 10% as per the documentation, but the actual implementation allows much higher fees.
3. Loss of Trust in the Protocol:
The discrepancy undermines user trust and the economic model stated by the protocol

### Mitigation

Modify the MAX_TOTAL_FEES constant to correctly represent 10%:

```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000;
```
