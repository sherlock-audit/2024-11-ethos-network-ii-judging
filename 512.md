# Malicious users can prevent legitimate vouches and degrade a profile's credibility by filling up the maximum vouches with minimal stakes

### Summary

Because there is no restriction on who can vouch for a profile and the minimum vouch amount is low, a malicious actor can cause a denial of service for legitimate vouches. By using multiple profiles to vouch for a target profile with the minimum stake, the attacker fills up the maximumVouches limit, preventing others from vouching. This causes a negative impact on the target profile's credibility, as credibility is based on stake value rather than the number of vouches.


### Root Cause

In the [vouchByProfileId](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L330-L415) function, there's no mechanism to prevent an attacker from exploiting the `maximumVouches` limit per subject profile. The attacker can use multiple profiles to vouch for a target profile with minimal amounts, filling up the vouch limit and degrading the profile's credibility.

```solidity
// Don't exceed maximum vouches per subject profile
if (vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId].length >= maximumVouches) {
  revert MaximumVouchesExceeded(
    vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId].length,
    "Exceeds subject vouch limit"
  );
}

```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Attacker controls multiple profiles: The attacker has or creates enough profiles (up to `maximumVouches`) to perform the attack.
2. Minimum vouch amount is low: The `configuredMinimumVouchAmount` is set to a low value (e.g., 0.0001 ETH, as it is currently set).
3. `maximumVouches` is low and can be reached (e.g., 256, as it is currently set).


### External pre-conditions

1. The malicious actor is able to create the necessary amount of profiles. (This is a valid concern as mentioned by the sponsor, since a possible scenario that slash can take place, is if "someone is using a bot/alts/sybil accounts to pad their ethos score".


### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates or controls multiple malicious profiles:
2. Each malicious profile vouches for the target profile:
    - Calls `vouchByProfileId` for the target `subjectProfileId` with the minimum stake amount.
    - Pays the minimal `configuredMinimumVouchAmount` (e.g., 0.0001 ETH) plus any applicable fees.
3. Fills up the `maximumVouches` limit.
4. Further vouch attempts by legitimate users are reverted with `MaximumVouchesExceeded`.


### Impact

The target profile cannot receive legitimate vouches due to the `maximumVouches` limit being reached with minimal stakes. This results in:

- Reputation Damage: The profile's credibility is significantly lowered.
- Denial of Service: Legitimate users are unable to vouch for the profile.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Possible mitigations of this issue could be:

- Adjust Vouch Limitation Mechanism:
    - Instead of limiting the number of vouches (`maximumVouches`), limit based on total stake amount or implement a hybrid model.
- Increase Minimum Vouch Amount:
    - Raise `configuredMinimumVouchAmount` to make such attacks economically unfeasible.
- Introduce Vouch Approval Process:
    - Allow subjects to approve or reject vouches to prevent unwanted or malicious vouches.
