# Incorrect fund calculation in `buyVotes()` locks funds in the contract or breaks core functions

### Summary

The function [withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L660) allows admins to withdraw the `marketFunds[profileId]` amount from a market after it has graduated.

When buying and selling votes, `marketFunds` is updated with the funds used for buying and selling votes.

When calling `buyVotes()`, the function calculates `fundsPaid` via `_calculateBuy()`:

```solidity
  function _calculateBuy(
  ...
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      uint256 newVotePrice,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    )
  {
    uint256 fundsAvailable;
    (fundsAvailable, protocolFee, donation) = previewFees(funds, true);

    ...

    while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
      fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
      fundsPaid += votePrice;
      votesBought++;

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    }
  ðŸ“Œ fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation; // fees are being added to fundsPaid
    ...
```

[_ReputationMarket.sol#942_](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L942)

As shown, `protocolFee` and `donation` are added to `fundsPaid`.

**The problem is** that `protocolFees` are sent out of this contract via `applyFees()` but are not subtracted from the `marketFunds` mapping.

### Root Cause

```solidity
  function buyVotes(
    ...
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);

    ...
    // Apply fees first
    applyFees(protocolFee, donation, profileId); // @audit protocolFee sent to protocolFeeAddress
    ...

    // tally market funds
  ðŸ“Œ marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid; // @audit protocolFee is not being subtracted
    ...
  }
```

[_ReputationMarket.sol#442_](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442)

As a result, `marketFunds` will be higher than the actual funds in the contract, causing `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()` to fail after a market graduates.

Even if multiple markets exist, `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()` will not fail outright but will **severely impact other markets and functions.**

This behavior is unintended and will consistently lead to significant issues, such as funds becoming stuck in the contract or core functions breaking.

### Internal pre-conditions

- `protocolFeeAddress` is set
- `protocolFee` is larger than 0 bps

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

- User buys or sells votes

### Impact

The `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` function will revert, locking funds in the contract.

### Additional impact

This example is only for one market being created. If multiple markets are created, funds won't be locked, but will affect other markets/functions severely. Examples:

- `sellVotes()` - admin may withdraw `marketFunds` via `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()`, depleting the contract balance, causing insufficient funds to pay vote sellers.
- `withdrawDonations()` - admin may withdraw `marketFunds`, leaving the contract balance less than `donationEscrow[msg.sender]`, making it impossible to withdraw donations.

Place the following code in `rep.market.test.ts` and run with `npm run test:contracts`.

```typescript
// eslint-disable-next-line vitest/expect-expect

  const amountToBuy = DEFAULT.buyAmount * 20n;
  const protocolFeeAddress: string = ethers.Wallet.createRandom().address;

  // setting a 2% fee
  await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints(200);

  // even worse, marketFunds continues to grow on subsequent buys

  await userA.buyVotes({

  await userA.sellVotes({
    sellVotes: positive,

```

</details>

- `protocolFee` is set to 2000 bps (2%)
- User buys votes for 100e18 wei
- Fees amount to 2e18 wei
- `protocolFee` is sent to `protocolFeeAddress`
- `ReputationMarket`'s `marketFunds` is increased by 100e18 wei, however, the actual contract balance is 98e18 wei.
- On `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()`, it reverts due to insufficient funds in the contract.
  _Example values are used for simplicity._


### Mitigation

Subtract fees from `marketFunds` in `buyVotes()`.

```solidity
function buyVotes(
  ...
  marketFunds[profileId] += (fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation);
  emit VotesBought(
  ...
```

Additionally, consider implementing an emergency withdrawal function for unforeseen scenarios.
