# `sellVotes()` lacks slippage protection, leading a severe fund losses

### Summary

Missing slippage checks in `sellVotes()`

### Root Cause

The `buyVotes()` function includes checks to prevent users from experiencing higher slippage when swapping ETH for votes. However, these checks are missing in `sellVotes()`, allowing an attacker to frontrun the victim's sell txn with another sell txn.  As a result, a sellers might end up selling their votes at a lower price than they initially expected.

### Attack Path

Follow the guided comments in attached PoC below.

### Impact
Loss of funds to seller

### PoC
> **Note:**  that frontrunning is not necessarily required here; in normal sequencing, it is also possible for users to lose if other sell transactions are executed first.

Start a [new](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/first-steps) foundry project, or simply run `forge init ./EthosTest`

Under a **./test/** dir, create a new file, paste the [linked](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/btorque0x/cd99026f93024ecc1eba75c5e27cfaff/raw/094115daa04f75e099c0f3bed9a684c35bdb2bad/EthosTest.sol) code, 

and run `forge test -vvvv`

Heres, the attached [SS](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1bb8298-a60b-42d3-88e5-58a4d6494d8d).

### Mitigation

Allow user to pass `expectedEth` as slippage parameter during `sellVotes()`, similar to `buyVotes()`.
