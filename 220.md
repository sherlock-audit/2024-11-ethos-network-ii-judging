### PoC

**Textual PoC**
1- let's assume base price 1 eth and there is 5 positive and 5 negative vote and userA decide to buy 2 vote with 1.1 eth with fee 5%
```javascript
      vote price = 5 * 1 / 10 = 0.5 first vote
      vote price = 6 * 1 / 11 = 0.52 second vote
      total vote price = 0.5 + 0.52 = 1.02 eth
      fee = (1.1 * 5) / 100 ‎ = 0.055 eth
      refund value = 1.1 - (1.02 + 0.055) = 0.025 eth
      
```      
its mean userA can buy 2 positive vote but when userA send its tx to network also userB tx for buy 5 negative vote will be executed its mean positive vote price will be decreased
```javascript
      vote price => 5 * 1 / 15 ‎ = 0.333 eth
      vote price = 6 * 1 / 16 ‎ = 0.375 eth
      total vote price = 0.333 + 0.375 ‎ = 0.708 eth
      refund value = 1.1 - (0.708 + 0.055) ‎ = 0.337 eth
      fee = (1.1 * 5) / 100 ‎ = 0.055 eth
      
```
as we can see fee will be computed based on 1.1 eth not based on 0.708 eth 
acutal fee = 0.708 * 5 / 100 ‎ = 0.0354 eth
fee user paid = (1.1 * 5) / 100 ‎ = 0.055 eth
user loss => 0.055 eth - 0.0354 eth = ‎ = 0.0196 eth
user loss in term of dollar => 0.0196 * 3500 = $68


### Impact

user pay fee more than actual value

### Mitigation

consider to compute fee based on fundsPaid
