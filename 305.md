# Missing pausability checks in `increaseVouch`

### Summary

The `increaseVouch` lacks the `whenNotPaused` modifier, allowing it to be used even when contract is paused.

### Root Cause

In [`EthosVouch:increaseVouch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426), the `whenNotPaused` modifier is missing, which allows the function to still be usable even if the contract is paused.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Calling `increaseVouch` even if the contract is paused.

### Impact

Medium. All user-facing functions in `EthosVouch` (except `increaseVouch`) are pausable, which makes it clear that the expected behavior is to restrict all functionality if the contract is paused. However, `increaseVouch` will still be usable, which 
breaks core contract functionality.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the `whenNotPaused` check to `EthosVouch`'s `increaseVouch` function.
