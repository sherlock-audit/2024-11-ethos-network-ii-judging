# User is able to took funds from previous vouchers pool even if he the only, who vouched

### Summary

The idea behind this vulnerability is that protocol is willing to reward guys, who early than everyone else vouch for profile of certain guys, so it is intended to be reward the old voucher from some small amount (voucherPoolFee) being charged from each new subsequent people who vouched for same profileId after the guy. This feature suppose to incentives people vouch for someone in case they think will act trustfully and a the future and will accumulate more vouches on them.

By design it is not intended to reward you, if you are the ONLY one who vouch for specific profileID. But lets consider the case, where we vouch for a guy with 10eth amount and then decided to increase the vouch with minimum required amount.
Once we vouched _rewardPreviousVouchers() won't let us grab a piece of voucher's pool fee bcs mapping vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId] being updated right after applyFess() -> _rewardPreviousVouchers() calls, but when we calling increaseVouch() function this mapping already holds the value.

Because this check in _rewardPreviousVouchers() completely wrong and it is just checks if there are any balance in a vouch, but not checking is this an only vouch => we receiving our "refund" even we the ONLY voucher for specific subjectId


### Root Cause

EthosVouch.sol: _rewardPreviousVouch()

```solidity
    uint256 totalBalance;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalVouches; i++) {
      Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]]; //Me 05 looks huge mistake
      // Only include active (not archived) vouches in the distribution
      if (!vouch.archived) {
        totalBalance += vouch.balance;
      }
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Vouch for the guy
Increase your vouch
it will refund more if initial amount is big, and amount of increasing don't really mater here 

### Impact

User getting refund from his initial vouch from reward previous vouchers pool, which was intended to distribute reward to another users

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

consider to end the function execution and return 0 if uint256 totalVouches = vouchIds.length array length is equal to 1
