# Voucher can avoid slash

## Root cause
The `unvouch` function lacks a waiting period, allowing users to immediately withdraw their funds.
According to the documentation, the slashing process requires some off-chain verification, and vounch more than 2 ETH allows participation in the slashing validation. 
This means that before the slashing is executed, the user who is about to be slashed may become aware of it and can immediately withdraw their funds to avoid being slashed.

    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
    _vouchShouldExist(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);
    // because it's $$$, you can only withdraw/unvouch to the same address you used to vouch
    // however, we don't care about the status of the address's profile; funds are always attached
    // to an address, not a profile
    if (vouches[vouchId].authorAddress != msg.sender) {
      revert AddressNotVouchAuthor(vouchId, msg.sender, vouches[vouchId].authorAddress);
    }

    v.archived = true;
    // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
    v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt = block.timestamp;
    // remove the vouch from the tracking arrays and index mappings
    _removeVouchFromArrays(v);

    // apply fees and determine how much is left to send back to the author
    (uint256 toWithdraw, ) = applyFees(v.balance, false, v.subjectProfileId);
    // set the balance to 0 and save back to storage
    v.balance = 0;
    // send the funds to the author
    // note: it sends it to the same address that vouched; not the one that called unvouch
    (bool success, ) = payable(v.authorAddress).call{ value: toWithdraw }("");
    if (!success) {
      revert FeeTransferFailed("Failed to send ETH to author");
    }

    emit Unvouched(v.vouchId, v.authorProfileId, v.subjectProfileId);
  }

## Impact
User may avoid slash
## Internal pre-condition

## External pre-condition
The user who is about to be slashed may learn this from the validator, or the user themselves might be the validator who is going to be slashed.

## PoC
1. The user called the `unvouch` function and withdrew all their funds.
2. The validation process is completed, and the slashing is executed, but since the user had already exited in advance, the protocol did not receive the slashing penalty.

## Mitigation
After calling the `unvouch` function, the user should not be able to immediately withdraw their funds. Instead, there should be a delay period before they can claim their funds. During this period, the funds are subject to being slashed if necessary.
