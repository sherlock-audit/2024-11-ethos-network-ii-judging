# Users can exploit huge sell/buy orders

### Summary

When selling/buying both functions have a while loop in order to calculate the price of each vote. This loop will limit the amount of votes users can buy, as the gas cost would surpass the block gas limit causing a revert. The only solution for this is the user to make a few TX if he wants to buy/sell a lot of tokens.

```solidity
    while (votesSold < amount) {
      if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
        revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
      }

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
      fundsReceived += votePrice;
      votesSold++;
    }
```

These TX can be front-run or the least back-run with buys or sells so that the attacker can MEV huge operations. Back-runs are possible on every chain as every block would be visible on it's chain scanner and since those TX would require most of the block space (if not all) it means that they all must be in separate blocks.

Note that this is possible on buy and on sell, but sell is gonna be the main problem as it lacks slippage protection. For buy it's still possible, since these would be separate TXs and the attacker buying in between, the slippage won't be preventing much as it would account the attacker's change in the new order (i.e. attacker would slip in between).

### Root Cause

The while loop limiting the amount of orders that can be bought at once

```solidity
    while (votesSold < amount) {
      if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
        revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
      }

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
      fundsReceived += votePrice;
      votesSold++;
    }
```

`sellVotes` not having a slippage check.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. A whale to make a sell order

### Attack Path

Most probable scenario
1. Whale makes a sell order to sell 10k votes, he would need to do 3 TX, 2 with 4k sells (theoretical max) and 1 with 2k sells
2. User sees the first executed TX and backruns it (possible on Base), knowing that 4k is the max and the whale will sell more than that
3. After the whale sold all 10k votes our user buys them back up again

The user sold high and bough low, thus making a profit.

Simpler scenario:
1. Whale makes a sell order to sell 10k votes
2. User sees that order and front-runs him by selling his votes first
3. After the whale sold he buys them back up again at a much lower price



### Impact

Whales are gonna be gamed by other users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider using another method to buy/sell votes (AMM curve with increase price impact (like curve stable swap, but the opposite)), or implement slippage protection on sell.
