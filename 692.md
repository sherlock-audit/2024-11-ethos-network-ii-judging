# Off by one issue for max vouches.

### Summary

As per the docs, user should be able to vouch for at most 256 profiles and not more than that. But he will not be able to vouch for 256th time either. There is off by one issue there. User should be able to vouch for maximum profile at max.

There is this check in `vouchByProfileId()` function:

```solidity
    // users can't exceed the maximum number of vouches
    if (vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId].length >= maximumVouches) {
      revert MaximumVouchesExceeded(
        vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId].length,
        "Exceeds author vouch limit"
      );
    }
```

We are checking for `vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId].length` to be greater than or equal to `maximumVouches` and if true we are revert. 

And during initialization, we are setting `maximumVouches` to `256`:

That means if user try to vouch for 256th profile, the transaction will revert. 

As per the invariants given on contest page, the maximum vouches cannot exceed 256:

> Maximum number of active vouches received by a profile cannot exceed 256

But the total 256 vouches will not be used. So user will have one less vouch. And since vouching is an important functionality, submitting it as a medium issue.

Will provide later if necessary since submitting this at last moment.

### Mitigation

```diff
    // users can't exceed the maximum number of vouches
-    if (vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId].length >=maximumVouches) {
+    if (vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId].length >maximumVouches) {
 
      revert MaximumVouchesExceeded(
        vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId].length,
        "Exceeds author vouch limit"
      );
    }
```
