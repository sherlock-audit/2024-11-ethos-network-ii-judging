# `whenNotPaused` modifier is missing in `EthosVouch.increaseVouch()`.

### Summary

`whenNotPaused` modifier is missing in `EthosVouch.increaseVouch()`, so the function will work when the contract is paused.

### Root Cause

In [`EthosVouch.sol:L426`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426), `whenNotPaused` modifier is missing.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

`EthosVouch.increaseVouch()` will work when `EthosVouch` contract is paused.

### PoC

`whenNotPaused` modifier is missing in `EthosVouch.increaseVouch()`.
All other functions such as `vouch`, `unvouch`, `mark unhealthy` and `slash` have the `whenNotPaused` modifier. So when paused the above functions will not work, but `increase vouch` will work although `EthosVouch` contract is paused. This is not correct behavior and `increase vouch` should not work when the contract is paused.

### Mitigation

It is recommended to add `whenNotPaused` modifier to `EthosVouch.increaseVouch()`.

```diff
-  function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable nonReentrant {
+  function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
```
