# Reputation market owners will not be able to withdraw donations if the donation recipient is compromised

### Summary

Currently, the donations for a market owner are tied to the donation recipient address. Additionally, the donation recipient address can [only](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L552) be changed by the current donation recipient. This causes donations to be lost if the donation recipient is compromised.

### Root Cause

In `ReputationMarket.sol:552` there is a check to ensure that only the current donation recipient can change it. Furthermore, in `ReputationMarket.sol:571` it is ensured that only the donation recipient can withdraw the donations.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `donationBasisPoints` for the reputation market need to be greater than `0`.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Alice creates a reputation market for her profile using one of the addresses associated with her profile. That address will be the donation recipient.
2. Bob calls `ReputationMarket::buyVotes()` to buy votes for the reputation market with the profileId of Alice.
3. The donations will be tied to the address Alice used to create the market.
4. That address is compromised.
5. Alice cannot change the donation recipient and cannot claim her donations by using any other address that is connected to her profileId.

### Impact

The user will not be able to withdraw the donations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider allowing any address associated with the same profileId to change the donation recipient and withdraw the donations.
