# max total fees can exceed 10%

### Summary

The readMe states that admin must be limited to a max total fees of 10%

> Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%

However the `MAX_TOTAL_FEE` is set to 100% and is immutable, therefore the limitation will not hold.

### Root Cause

In EthosVouch.sol ln 120
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120

```solidity
  uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
```

The max total fees has been incorrectly set to 100% therefore breaking the limitation that admins can not set max total fees greater than 10%

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. admin can set max total fees >10% breaking the limitation.

### Impact

 admin can set max total fees >10% breaking the limitation.
 
 As stated from the readMe admins should  not be able to set max total fees >10%

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

change the fee to 10% or 1000 basis points.
