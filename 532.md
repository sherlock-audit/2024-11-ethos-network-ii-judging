# `ReputationMarket::_calculateBuy` returns incorrect `maxPrice`

### Summary

The `_calculateBuy` function returns incorrectly calculated `maxPrice` when a user purchases votes.
Here is where the in incorrect value is returned:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L982

### Root Cause

Here is snippet of the incorrect code:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L976-L982

Towards the end of the function the `votePrice` is calculated again on line 976. Now the `votePrice` is updated to be the price of a future vote. Then later the `maxPrice` is set as the `votePrice`. However, the problem is that the price is of a future vote and not the actual max price that the user purchased a vote at. 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Incorrect `voteMaxPrice` is returned from the `_calculateBuy` function

### PoC

Import hardhat console into the `ReputationMarket.sol` contract:
```solidity
//@audit added
import "hardhat/console.sol";
```

After line #980 add the following logger
```solidity
console.log("The max vote purchase price is:", maxPrice);
```
After line #478
```solidity
console.log("The funds paid for votes:", fundsPaid);
```

Lastly add the following test into the `rep.market.test.ts` file
```typescript
  it('The max price is incorrect is _calculateBuy', async () => {
    const { fundsPaid } = await userA.buyOneVote();
    const { fundsReceived } = await userA.sellOneVote();
  });        
```

After running the test you will get the following output:

```shell
  ReputationMarket
The max vote purchase price is: 6666666666666666
The max vote purchase price is: 6666666666666666
The funds paid for votes: 5000000000000000

```

Notice this test purchases one vote for the total price of `5000000000000000` which is less than the reported `maxPrice` for one vote which is `6666666666666666` which is incorrect. In conclusion, the `maxVotePrice` cannot be greater than the total price when buying votes.


### Mitigation

Make the following changes to the `ReputationMarket::_calculateBuy`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L970C1-L977C5

```diff
   while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
+    votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
      fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
      fundsPaid += votePrice;
      votesBought++;

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += 1;
-      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    }
```
