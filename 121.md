# More than intended fund will be withdrawn from graduated markets due to wrongly update ````marketFunds```` while ````sellVotes()````

### Summary

In ````ReputationMarket.sellVotes()````, both  ````fundsReceived```` for seller and the ````protocolFee```` are paid from ````ReputationMarket```` contract, but only the first part is subtracted from the ````marketFunds```` state variable, the ````protocolFee```` is not. It causes more than intended fund to be withdrawn while ````withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()```` is subsequently called.

### Root Cause
The issue arises on [L522](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L522) of ````ReputationMarket.sellVotes()````, we can see both ````fundsReceived```` (````L520````) and ````protocolFee```` (````L517````, ````L1123````) are sent out from ````ReputationMarket```` contract, but only ````fundsReceived```` is subtracted from ````marketFunds[profileId]````.
```solidity
File: contracts\ReputationMarket.sol
495:   function sellVotes(
496:     uint256 profileId,
497:     bool isPositive,
498:     uint256 amount
499:   ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
...
503:     (
...
505:       uint256 fundsReceived,
506:       ,
507:       uint256 protocolFee,
...
510:     ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);
511: 
...
517:     applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);
518: 
...
520:     _sendEth(fundsReceived);
...
522:     marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived; // @audit missing to subtract protocolFee
...
534:   }

File: contracts\ReputationMarket.sol
1116:   function applyFees(
...
1120:   ) private returns (uint256 fees) {
...
1122:     if (protocolFee > 0) {
1123:       (bool success, ) = protocolFeeAddress.call{ value: protocolFee }("");
1124:       if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Protocol fee deposit failed");
1125:     }
...
1127:   }

```
And later while the market is graduated, the remaining ````marketFunds[profileId]```` is sent out at ````L675```` of ````withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()````. Therefore, the ````protocolFee```` part is double spending out.

```solidity
File: contracts\ReputationMarket.sol
660:   function withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(uint256 profileId) public whenNotPaused {
...
675:     _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]);
...
678:   }

```

### Internal pre-conditions

protocolFee is not zero

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Calling ````ReputationMarket.sellVotes()```` by any votes holder.

### Impact

The ````ReputationMarket```` lost partial of funds

### PoC

_No response_
