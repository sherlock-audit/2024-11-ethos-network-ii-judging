# When calculating the outcome of a sell transaction, the calculation of amount received after fees was incorrect.

### Summary

In the function _calculateSell of ReputationMarket.sol, you added the updated vote price instead of adding the current vote price. This causes the calculation of fundsReceived to be incorrect.

### Root Cause

In the code below, you need to reverse the order of the two lines.
1037 : votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
1038 : fundsReceived += votePrice;

Updated code:
1037 : fundsReceived += votePrice;
1038 : votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
