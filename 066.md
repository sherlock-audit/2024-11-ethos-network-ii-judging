# `ReputationMarket.withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()` will revert making admin lose blocked ETH

### Summary

Variable `marketFunds` is incorrectly updated in `ReputationMarket.buyVotes()`. Therefore `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()` will revert. As a result admin can't withdraw ETH from market.

Additionally it voilates stated in Readme:
>What properties/invariants do you want to hold even if breaking them has a low/unknown impact?

>The vouch and vault contracts must never revert a transaction due to running out of funds.

### Root Cause

-In [buyVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481) `marketFunds` is incorrectly updated. It uses `fundsPaid` which consists of "paidPrice" + "fees". Problem is that it only must contain "paidPrice" value without fees.
-In [sellVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L522) `marketFunds` is incorrectly updated. It uses funds after fees are deducted.

Correct way to update is to use purchase amount after fees deducted in buy; and amount before fees deducted in sell.

### Attack Path

Sooner or later revert happens, I will describe simpler scenario:
1) Suppose protocolFee is 5%, donation is 5%; `initialLiquidity = 0 ETH`.
2) User executes `buyVotes()`. Purchase amount is 0.9 ETH; protocolFee = 0.05 ETH; donationFee = 0.05 ETH. `marketFunds += 1 ETH`, should be 0.9 ETH.
3) User executes `sellVotes()` to sell bought votes. He receives 0.81 ETH; protocolFee = 0.045 ETH; donationFee = 0.045 ETH. `marketFunds = 1 ETH - 0.81 ETH = 0.19 ETH`, should be 0 ETH.
5) Market is graduated and `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()` is called. In case there is balance, donationFee = 0.095 ETH can't be withdrawn; otherwise it will revert with insufficient balance.

So `marketFunds` always overestimate real funds, so sooner or later either party loses funds.

### Impact

- Donation fees can't be withdrawn
- Graduated market funds can't be withdrawn
- It violates Readme because there will be reverts due to running out of funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Correct way to update is to use purchase amount after fees deducted in buy; and amount before fees deducted in sell.
