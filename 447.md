# Buyers pay more fees unfairly when buying votes.

### Summary
Buyers pay fees when they buy votes. However, the amount of fee is calculated with the `msg.value`, which leads to loss of fund to buyers.

### Root Cause
Buyers pay `protocolFee` and `donation` when they buy votes.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L451-L459
```solidity
    (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);
```

And, the amount of fees is calculated with the `msg.value`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L960
```solidity
    (fundsAvailable, protocolFee, donation) = previewFees(funds, true);
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1146-L1147
```solidity
      function previewFees(
        uint256 amount,
        bool isEntry
      ) private view returns (uint256 funds, uint256 protocolFee, uint256 donation) {
        if (isEntry) {
1146:     protocolFee = (amount * entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;
1147:     donation = (amount * donationBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;
        } else {
          protocolFee = (amount * exitProtocolFeeBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;
        }
        funds = amount - protocolFee - donation;
      }
```

However, the funds sent to market are partially used for buying votes(only `fundsPaid`), which means that the buyers should pay for the amount which is not used for buying.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L970-L977
```solidity
    while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
      fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
      fundsPaid += votePrice;
      votesBought++;

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    }
```

Buyers pay more fees unfairly.

### Mitigation

The amount of fee should be calculated with the amount paid actually for buying.
