# Maximum total fees can exceed 10% in EthosVouch

### Summary

According to the documentation, maximum total fees cannot exceed 10% but in the code the max fee for total fees in EthosVouch was set to 10000 basis point which is equivalent to 100%.

```solidity
 // --- Constants ---
  uint256 private constant ABSOLUTE_MINIMUM_VOUCH_AMOUNT = 0.0001 ether;
@>  uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
  uint256 public constant BASIS_POINT_SCALE = 10000;
  uint256 public constant MAX_SLASH_PERCENTAGE = 1000;


  function checkFeeExceedsMaximum(uint256 currentFee, uint256 newFee) internal view {
    uint256 totalFees = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints +
      exitFeeBasisPoints +
      entryDonationFeeBasisPoints +
      entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints +
      newFee -
      currentFee;
    if (totalFees > MAX_TOTAL_FEES) revert FeesExceedMaximum(totalFees, MAX_TOTAL_FEES);
  }
```

MAX_TOTAL_FEES was set to 10000 and this will cause the checkFeeExceedsMaximum to pass when total fees is more than 10%.
