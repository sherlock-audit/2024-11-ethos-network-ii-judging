# Fee Mismanagement in the `ReputationMarket.buyVotes` Function

### Summary

In the `ReputationMarket` contract, the `buyVotes` function currently accumulates `fundsPaid`, which inadvertently includes both the protocol entry fee and donation fee into `marketFunds`. This results in the protocol fee being transferred twice in the `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` function, leading to a potential loss of funds for the protocol.

### Root Cause

The issue originates in the `_calculateBuy` function, where `fundsPaid` is calculated to include the `protocolFee` and `donation` as shown.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/tree/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L978

```solidity
    fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;
```

In the `buyVotes` function, the protocol and donation fee are transferred to the `protocolFeeAddress` and stored in the `donationEscrow` variable. However, the total `fundsPaid` is then added to `marketFunds[profileId]` at line 481:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/tree/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L464-L481

```solidity
@>  applyFees(protocolFee, donation, profileId);

    // Update market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += votesBought;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += votesBought;

    // Add buyer to participants if not already a participant
    if (!isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender]) {
      participants[profileId].push(msg.sender);
      isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = true;
    }

    // Calculate and refund remaining funds
    uint256 refund = msg.value - fundsPaid;
    if (refund > 0) _sendEth(refund);

    // tally market funds
@>  marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
```

In the `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` function, the entire amount in `marketFunds[profileId]` is sent to the authorized graduation withdrawal address:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/tree/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L675

```solidity
  function withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(uint256 profileId) public whenNotPaused {
    address authorizedAddress = contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(
      "GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL"
    );
    if (msg.sender != authorizedAddress) {
      revert UnauthorizedWithdrawal();
    }
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);
    if (!graduatedMarkets[profileId]) {
      revert MarketNotGraduated();
    }
    if (marketFunds[profileId] == 0) {
      revert InsufficientFunds();
    }

@>  _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]);
    emit MarketFundsWithdrawn(profileId, msg.sender, marketFunds[profileId]);
    marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
  }
```

This process inadvertently attempts to transfer the fee amounts as well, leading to the double counting of fees.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

1. None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Fee mismanagement causes the protocol's loss of funds.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

In the `buyVotes` function, subtract protocol and donation fee from `marketFunds[profileId]`
