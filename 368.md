# When buying votes, protocol and donation fees are accidentally added to the market funds

### Summary
```solidity
    (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);

    _checkSlippageLimit(votesBought, expectedVotes, slippageBasisPoints);

    // Apply fees first
    applyFees(protocolFee, donation, profileId);

    // Update market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += votesBought;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += votesBought;

    // Add buyer to participants if not already a participant
    if (!isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender]) {
      participants[profileId].push(msg.sender);
      isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = true;
    }

    // Calculate and refund remaining funds
    uint256 refund = msg.value - fundsPaid;
    if (refund > 0) _sendEth(refund);

    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
```

As we can see, when buying votes, `_calculateBuy` returns the total amount of funds paid by the user (inclusive of fees) and also separately returns the protocolFee and donation. 

The fees are then distributed both to the protocol and to the donation recipient 

```solidity
  function applyFees(
    uint256 protocolFee,
    uint256 donation,
    uint256 marketOwnerProfileId
  ) private returns (uint256 fees) {
    donationEscrow[donationRecipient[marketOwnerProfileId]] += donation;
    if (protocolFee > 0) {
      (bool success, ) = protocolFeeAddress.call{ value: protocolFee }("");
      if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Protocol fee deposit failed");
    }
    fees = protocolFee + donation;
  }
```

The problem is that then the amount of funds added to the  `marketFunds` is the total amount which is inclusive of the already distributed fees.

```solidity
    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
```



### Root Cause
Wrong logic 

### Impact
Double spending funds

### Mitigation
Add to market funds `fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation`
