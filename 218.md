# Users would receive rewards even if their vouch balance is bellow the min

### Summary

`EthosVouch` has a min cap for making a vouch, which is 0.0001 ETH. That is in order for users to not create vouches with dust amounts.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L119
```solidity
  uint256 private constant ABSOLUTE_MINIMUM_VOUCH_AMOUNT = 0.0001 ether;
```

That can is used when making a vouch:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L379-L382
```solidity
    // must meet the minimum vouch amount
    if (msg.value < configuredMinimumVouchAmount) {
      revert MinimumVouchAmount(configuredMinimumVouchAmount);
    }
```


Or when increasing one:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426-L430
```solidity
  function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable nonReentrant {
    // vouch increases much also meet the minimum vouch amount
    if (msg.value < configuredMinimumVouchAmount) {
      revert MinimumVouchAmount(configuredMinimumVouchAmount);
    }
```

However that cap is not confirmed when slashing is performed, meaning users can have vouches less than that minimum 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L528-L555
```solidity
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchIds.length; i++) {
      Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];

      if (!vouch.archived) {
        uint256 slashAmount = vouch.balance.mulDiv(
          slashBasisPoints,
          BASIS_POINT_SCALE,
          Math.Rounding.Floor
        );
        if (slashAmount > 0) {
          vouch.balance -= slashAmount;
          totalSlashed += slashAmount;
        }
      }
    }

    if (totalSlashed > 0) {
      // Send slashed funds to protocol fee address
      (bool success, ) = protocolFeeAddress.call{ value: totalSlashed }("");
      if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Slash transfer failed");
    }
```

With those vouches users still show support and earn rewards, even thought their vouches would be bellow the min requirement and can be considered dust. 

### Root Cause

`slash` not validation vouches for their minimum balance

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `slash` must be called on a user with near `configuredMinimumVouchAmount` amount

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice has a few vouches that are near the min allowed
2. Alice misbehaves and gets slashed
3. Her vouches are not bellow `configuredMinimumVouchAmount`
4. Since they are small in balance it's not worth getting them out

These vouches would:
1. Earn rewards, even though they are bellow the min and considered dust
2. Show support (as another user vouching)
3. Take space and act as dead weight, as users can have up to 256 vouchers and these dust vouches would just take some of the slots, where real vouchers with bigger vouches would gladly be

### Impact

Vouches containing only dust will earn rewards and show support. They would also clog the system as every user can have up to 256 vouchers.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Since that amount would be too small, `slash` can take that amount also in order for those vouches to not be left as dead weight.
