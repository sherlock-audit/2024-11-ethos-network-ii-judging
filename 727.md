# in `sellVotes`, participants who sold all their shares are not removed from the array

## Summary

When participant's shares reach zero in `sellVotes`, they are not removed from the participants array.
 
```solidity
function sellVotes(
  uint256 profileId,
  bool isPositive,
  uint256 amount
) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
  _checkMarketExists(profileId);

  // calculate the amount of votes to sell and the funds received
  (
    uint256 votesSold,
    uint256 fundsReceived,
    ,
    uint256 protocolFee,
    uint256 minVotePrice,
    uint256 maxVotePrice
  ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);

  // update the market state
  markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
  votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;

  // apply protocol fees
  applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

  // send the proceeds to the seller
  _sendEth(fundsReceived);
  // tally market funds
  marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
  emit VotesSold(
    profileId,
    msg.sender,
    isPositive,
    votesSold,
    fundsReceived,
    block.timestamp,
    minVotePrice,
    maxVotePrice
  );
  _emitMarketUpdate(profileId);
}
```

## Impact

They are still regarded as a participant even though they no longer hold shares.

## Recommendation
Remove them from the array when share balance hits 0.
