# ReputationMarket's max fees are 15% instead of 10%

### Summary

The README clearly states that the max fees for both contracts should be 10%.

>For both contracts:
> - Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%

However that is clearly not the case for `ReputationMarket` as it's max fees can be set to 15%. That is possible as both entry and exit fees are checked for not to be bigger than 5% each, but at the same time donation fee is also checked for not to be bigger than 5%.

```solidity
  uint256 private constant MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE_BASIS_POINTS = 500; // 5%
  uint256 private constant MAX_DONATION_BASIS_POINTS = 500; // 5%
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L593-L624
```solidity
  function setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints(uint256 basisPoints) public onlyAdmin whenNotPaused {
    if (protocolFeeAddress == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    if (basisPoints > MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE_BASIS_POINTS) {
      revert InvalidMarketConfigOption("Fee exceeds maximum");
    }
    entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints = basisPoints;
  }

  function setExitProtocolFeeBasisPoints(uint256 basisPoints) public onlyAdmin whenNotPaused {
    if (protocolFeeAddress == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();
    if (basisPoints > MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE_BASIS_POINTS) {
      revert InvalidMarketConfigOption("Fee exceeds maximum");
    }
    exitProtocolFeeBasisPoints = basisPoints;
  }

  function setDonationBasisPoints(uint256 basisPoints) public onlyAdmin whenNotPaused {
    if (basisPoints > MAX_DONATION_BASIS_POINTS) {
      revert InvalidMarketConfigOption("Donation exceeds maximum");
    }
    donationBasisPoints = basisPoints;
  }
```

If all fees are set to their max, the new total will be 15% - 5% entry, 5% exit and 5% donation.

### Root Cause

3 different fees, each allowing max 5% on their own, resulting in `3 * 5% = 15%` total fees

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Even though these fees are set by an admin, the current system wants to be transparent to it's users when it comes to fees (else these checks would not have been there). As so they have requested in the README for both contracts to be verified that their max total fees are 10%.

> For both contracts:
> - Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%

Also this vitiates the README.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Just as in `EthosVouch` verify that all of the fees combined do not surpass the max allowed. Consider adding the following code and changing the functions.

```solidity
    uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000;

    function checkFeeExceedsMaximum(uint256 currentFee, uint256 newFee) internal view {
      uint256 totalFees =
      entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints
      exitProtocolFeeBasisPoints
      donationBasisPoints
      newFee -
      currentFee;
      if (totalFees > MAX_TOTAL_FEES) revert FeesExceedMaximum(totalFees, MAX_TOTAL_FEES);
    }
```

Example for `setDonationBasisPoints`
```diff
  function setDonationBasisPoints(uint256 basisPoints) public onlyAdmin whenNotPaused {
    if (basisPoints > MAX_DONATION_BASIS_POINTS) {
      revert InvalidMarketConfigOption("Donation exceeds maximum");
    }
+  checkFeeExceedsMaximum(donationBasisPoints, basisPoints);
    donationBasisPoints = basisPoints;
  }

```
