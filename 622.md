# Fee taken on unused amount is not returned during `_calculateBuy()`

### Summary

During `_calculateBuy()` the fee is charged initially only on the msg.value send. The fee taken on the unused amount is not returned if there is an unused amount of ETH while buying tokens.

### Attack Path

- During buyVotes() we pass msg.value to get certain number of votes.
- Let's understand using an Ex.
- A user wants to buy vote tokens of 0.01 ether in some profile Id where config is of 0 index.
- Then _calculateBuy() gets called 
```solidity
 function _calculateBuy(
    Market memory market,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 funds
  )
    private
    view
    returns (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      uint256 newVotePrice,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    )
  {
    uint256 fundsAvailable;
    (fundsAvailable, protocolFee, donation) = previewFees(funds, true);
    uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);

    uint256 minPrice = votePrice;
    uint256 maxPrice;

    if (fundsAvailable < votePrice) {
      revert InsufficientFunds();
    }

    while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
      fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
      fundsPaid += votePrice;
      votesBought++;

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    }
    fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;

    maxPrice = votePrice;

    return (votesBought, fundsPaid, votePrice, protocolFee, donation, minPrice, maxPrice);
  }
```
- First the fees gets applied on 0.01 ether then the execution comes down to while loop where `fundsAvailable` = 0.01 ether and `votePrice` = 0.005 ether (assume there is no previous sell or buy)
- First time the while loop gets executed now the values would be fundsAvailable = 0.005 and votePrice = 0.0066
- So now the while loop won't be executed.
- Now if we see the fee gets charged on whole msg.value (0.01 ether) but due to market price only 0.005 ether gets used so the fees charged on extra 0.005 ether is not being return to user which causes of loss of user funds to user.

### Impact

- Loss of users funds as the fees taken upon unused amount of ETH while buying tokens is not being returned.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Fee should be only charged upon the amount of ETH used for buying .
- Implement logic of sellVotes() where the fee is charged upon correct amount.
