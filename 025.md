# `marketFunds` will be wrongly updated when votes are sold

### Summary

When votes are sold, `marketFunds` is not decreased by the protocol fee, taken out of the total votes price, causing the `marketFunds` for that market to be higher than they actually are.

### Root Cause

In `sellVotes:522` `marketFunds` is decreased by `fundsReceived`. This is an issue as `fundsReceived` does not include the protocol fees, deducted from the total cost of the votes: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1041. 

Therefore, `marketFunds` will be higher than the actual funds of the market. This is problematic as when the market is graduated and its funds are withdrawn through `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` more ETH will be withdrawn than available. This will either cause the withdrawal to revert, or the additional assets to be taken out of the funds of other markets.

### Attack Path

Here is a simple example:

1. A market has 10 ETH of funds
2. User sells 1 ETH of votes and has to pay 0.1 ETH in fees
3. Only 0.9ETH is deducted from `marketFunds`, due to the issue, so the market will have a `marketFunds` of 9.1 ETH, even though there are only 9 ETH
4. Now when the market is graduated and withdrawn, the withdrawal will revert, due to a lack of funds

### Impact

Withdrawing a graduated market will either revert, or assets will be taken out of the funds of other markets.

### Mitigation

Update `sellVotes` to include the protocol fees:
