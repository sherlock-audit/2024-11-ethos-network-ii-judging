# Wrong max feee

### Summary

The README clearly states that the max fee should be no more than 10%

> For both contracts:
> - Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%


However that is not true for EthosVouch as the max allowed fee there  is 100%

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120

```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;

  function checkFeeExceedsMaximum(uint256 currentFee, uint256 newFee) internal view {
    uint256 totalFees = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints +
      exitFeeBasisPoints +
      entryDonationFeeBasisPoints +
      entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints +
      newFee -
      currentFee;
    if (totalFees > MAX_TOTAL_FEES) revert FeesExceedMaximum(totalFees, MAX_TOTAL_FEES);
  }
```

Even though this can be considered admin issue, we should not forget that the README must be followed strictly, and since this issue breaks one of it's core designs it can be considered Medium.

### Root Cause

Wrong total fee

```solidity
  uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Fee can be set to 100%
README is violated 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix it by removing 0, thus reducing the max fee from 100% to 10%
