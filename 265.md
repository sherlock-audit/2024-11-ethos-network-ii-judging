# Incorrect check in `createMarketWithConfig()` disallows users from creating a market when they should be able to do so and allows users to create a market when they should not be able to do so


## Description

**Context:**

Users with an active Ethos profile can [create a reputation market](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L276-L293) for their profile. In return, they [earn a donation fee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1121) whenever another user [buys trust/distrust votes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442-L493) from that reputation market. Other users purchase trust/distrust votes to make a profit. This operates similarly to crypto trading:

- Scenario 1 (Trust Votes): A user predicts that others will view a profile as trustworthy. he buys trust votes early and [sell](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L534) them later when others bought trust votes, earning a profit.
- Scenario 2 (Distrust Votes): A user predicts others will view a profile as untrustworthy. They buy distrust votes early and [sell](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L534) them later after others follow, again earning a profit.

**Vulnerability Details:**

There are two scenarios where reputation market creation can occur:

1. Market creation is allowed for everyone.
2. only whitelisted users can create a market and non-whitelisted users cannot.

The `ReputationMarket` contract has a state variable called `bool enforceCreationAllowList`, which is explained as follows:

[ReputationMarket.sol#L133-L134](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L133-L134):

```solidity
  // This is used to control whether anyone can create a market or only the contract admin or addresses in the allow list.
  bool private enforceCreationAllowList;
```

after deploying the contract, deployer initializes the proxy by calling [initialize()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L201-L254) function. this function sets `enforceCreationAllowList` to `true`, allowing anyone to create a reputation market. However, the function responsible for market creation, [createMarketWithConfig()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L281-L293), contains the following check:

[ReputationMarket.sol#L284-L291](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L285-L291):

```solidity
  function createMarketWithConfig(uint256 marketConfigIndex) public payable whenNotPaused {

    ...
    if (enforceCreationAllowList && !creationAllowedProfileIds[senderProfileId]) {
      revert MarketCreationUnauthorized(
        MarketCreationErrorCode.PROFILE_NOT_AUTHORIZED,
        msg.sender,
        senderProfileId
      );
    }    
    ...

  }
```

The [creationAllowedProfileIds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L129-L131) mapping is used to whitelist specific users permitted to create reputation markets. By default, this mapping is set to `false` for all users. As a result, the if statement will cause a revert because both if statement conditions evaluate to `true`, when a user attempts to create a market.

Also if Admin sets the `enforceCreationAllowList` to `false`, all users can create reputation markets, even when they should not be authorized to do so.

This creates a scenario where:

1. Users cannot create a market when they should be allowed to.
2. Users can create a market when they should not be allowed to.

## Impact

**Damage:** Medium

**Likelihood:** High

**Details:** Users are unable to create a reputation market when they should be authorized to do so and Unauthorized users can create a reputation market when they should not be able to.

## Proof of Concept

**Attack Path:**

Example 1: 

1. `enforceCreationAllowList` is set to `true`.
2. user calls `createMarketWithConfig()`, and the function reverts.

Example 2:

1. `enforceCreationAllowList` is set to `false`.
2. A user calls `createMarketWithConfig()`, and the function does not revert when it should.

**POC:**

- Not Needed

## Recommended Mitigation

Refactor the if statement to correctly validate whether the user is authorized to create a reputation market:

```diff

  function createMarketWithConfig(uint256 marketConfigIndex) public payable whenNotPaused {

    ...

-   if (enforceCreationAllowList && !creationAllowedProfileIds[senderProfileId]) {
-     revert MarketCreationUnauthorized(
-       MarketCreationErrorCode.PROFILE_NOT_AUTHORIZED,
-       msg.sender,
-       senderProfileId
-     );
-   }    

+   if (!enforceCreationAllowList) {
+     if (!creationAllowedProfileIds[senderProfileId]) {
+       revert MarketCreationUnauthorized(
+         MarketCreationErrorCode.PROFILE_NOT_AUTHORIZED,
+         msg.sender,
+         senderProfileId
+       );
+     }
+   }    

    ...

  }
```
