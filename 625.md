# flawed balance update

### Summary

When users purchase votes, the total amount they spend (fundsPaid) includes not only the vote price and donation but also the protocol fee. However, the entire fundsPaid amount is incorrectly added to the market funds, inflating the market balance with amounts that should not be counted as part of the market's funds (such as the protocol fee and donation).

The fundsPaid value reflects the total transaction amount, which is meant to cover the vote price and donations, as well as the protocol fee. The protocol fee and donation is not intended to be part of the market funds, but the current implementation adds the entire fundsPaid amount to the market balance. This causes the market funds to be inflated by the protocol fee and donation amounts, leading to incorrect balance updates.

as we can see here it incorrectly adds the full funds paid to market funds

the funds paid is the total of vote price donation and protocol fee 

when the contract tries to withdraw this incorrect balance in graduation market withdrawal the it will cause unexpected errors

### Impact

this will either revert locking the funds in due to trying to withdraw more than the actual balance or it will end up withdrawing more than the actual balance of the given market which can lead to drainage of funds which were not meant for that market
