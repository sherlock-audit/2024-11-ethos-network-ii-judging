# Incorrect Fee Calculation in EthosVouch Contract Leads to Protocol Financial Loss

## Impact
High. The `calcFee` function in EthosVouch.sol calculates fees based on the deposit amount (amount after fee deduction) rather than the total amount sent by the user, resulting in systematic undercharging of fees. This affects all fee types (protocol, donation, vouchers pool, and exit fees), leading to direct financial loss for the protocol and its stakeholders.

## Vulnerability Details
The current implementation in `[calcFee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L975-L989)` function uses a "backwards" calculation that results in lower fees than intended:

```solidity
function calcFee(uint256 total, uint256 feeBasisPoints) internal pure returns (uint256 fee) {
    return total - (total.mulDiv(BASIS_POINT_SCALE, (BASIS_POINT_SCALE + feeBasisPoints), Math.Rounding.Floor));
}
```

### Mathematical Analysis
For a transaction of 100 ETH with a 1% fee (100 basis points):

**Current Implementation:**
1. `deposit = 100 ETH * 10000 / (10000 + 100)` ≈ 99.0099 ETH
2. `fee = 100 - 99.0099` = 0.9901 ETH

**Expected Implementation:**
1. `fee = 100 ETH * 100 / 10000` = 1.0000 ETH

The difference of 0.0099 ETH (≈1% of the fee) is lost for each fee calculation.

## Impact Amplification
The impact is amplified by:
1. Multiple fee types being charged in the same transaction
2. Larger transaction amounts
3. Higher fee percentages
4. Frequent transactions

## Code Snippet
```solidity
// Location: EthosVouch.sol:202
function calcFee(uint256 total, uint256 feeBasisPoints) internal pure returns (uint256 fee) {
    /*
     * Formula derivation:
     * 1. total = deposit + fee
     * 2. fee = deposit * (feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 3. total = deposit + deposit * (feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 4. total = deposit * (1 + feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 5. deposit = total / (1 + feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 6. fee = total - deposit
     * 7. fee = total - (total * 10000 / (10000 + feeBasisPoints))
     */
    return total - (total.mulDiv(BASIS_POINT_SCALE, (BASIS_POINT_SCALE + feeBasisPoints), Math.Rounding.Floor));
}
```

## Proof of Concept
```solidity
// Test case demonstrating the vulnerability
function testFeeCalculationLoss() public {
    uint256 amount = 100 ether;
    uint256 feeBasisPoints = 100; // 1%
    
    // Current implementation
    uint256 actualFee = calcFee(amount, feeBasisPoints);
    // ≈ 0.9901 ETH
    
    // Expected calculation
    uint256 expectedFee = amount * feeBasisPoints / BASIS_POINT_SCALE;
    // = 1.0000 ETH
    
    // Demonstrates loss
    assert(actualFee < expectedFee);
    // Loss is approximately 0.0099 ETH per fee
}
```

## Recommended Fix
Replace the current `calcFee` implementation with a direct percentage calculation:

```solidity
function calcFee(uint256 total, uint256 feeBasisPoints) internal pure returns (uint256 fee) {
    return total * feeBasisPoints / BASIS_POINT_SCALE;
}
```

## Tools Used
- Manual code review
- Mathematical analysis
- Test case simulation

## Recommendation
1. Implement the corrected fee calculation formula as shown above
2. Add comprehensive test cases covering various fee scenarios
3. Consider adding invariant checks to ensure fee calculations meet expected percentages
4. Document the fee calculation methodology clearly in the contract comments

## Risk Categorization
- Impact: High (Direct financial loss)
- Likelihood: High (Affects every transaction)
- Complexity: Low (Simple mathematical error)
- Priority: Immediate fix required
