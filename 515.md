# Incorrect fee calculation allows total fees to exceed intended 10% limit, causing users to pay excessive fees

### Summary

The misconfiguration of the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` constant and the fee calculation method in the `EthosVouch` contract will cause excessive fees for users. The `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is set to `10000` basis points, but due to the fee calculation formula, users can be charged fees higher than the intended maximum of 10%. For instance, setting total fee basis points to `10000` results in a 50% fee, surpassing the maximum of 10%, leading to users paying more than expected.


### Root Cause

In the [EthosVouch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120) contract, the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` constant is set to `10000`. Additionally, the [calcFee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L975-L989) function uses a fee calculation formula that causes the actual fee percentage, leading to higher fees than the maximum allowed.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. The admin sets one or more fee basis points (e.g., `entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints`, `entryDonationFeeBasisPoints`, `entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints`, `exitFeeBasisPoints`) such that their sum reaches `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` (currently `10000` basis points).


### External pre-conditions

1. There is any external pre-condition, just only that users have to interact with the `EthosVouch` contract by performing transactions that involve fees.

### Attack Path

1. Admin sets total fee basis points to `10000` of just one of the fees, so as to make the scenario as simple as possible. That passes successfully the `require` check in the `checkFeeExceedsMaximum` function.
2. User calls any function that uses fees, such as `vouchByProfileId`**, sending an amount of ETH to stake.
3. The `applyFees` function calculates the fees using the `calcFee` method.
4. Due to the fee calculation formula, the user is charged a 50% fee instead of the intended 10%.
5. User ends up depositing less than expected, losing additional funds to high fees.

To explain further the 4th step of this, since we have simplified this scenario, and we only have one fee that is set to the maximum allowed of 10000, to use the calculation formula that is in comments above the `calcFee` function that is correct, we end in:

```sol
fee = total - (total * 10000 / (10000 + feeBasisPoints))
fee = total - (total * 10000 / (10000 + 10000))
fee = total - (total * 10000 / (20000))
fee = total - total/2
fee = total/2
```
so the maximum fee is 50%

### Impact

Users suffer a significant loss by paying excessive fees exceeding the intended 10% limit. This can lead to a loss of up to 50% of their transaction amount.

### Mitigation


- Adjust the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` constant: Change `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` from `10000` to approximately `1111` basis points to reflect a 10% maximum fee when using the current fee calculation formula.

**Explanation**

To ensure the fee does not exceed 10% of the total amount, the `feeBasisPoints` should be calculated as follows:

Let `fee / total = 0.1` (10% fee):

```sol
fee = total - (total * 10000 / (10000 + feeBasisPoints)) 
fee / total = 1 - ( 1 * 10000 / 10000 + feeBasisPoints))
0.1 = 1 - ( 1 * 10000 / 10000 + feeBasisPoints))
(10000 + feeBasisPoints) / 10 = (10000 + feeBasisPoints) - 10000
(10000 + feeBasisPoints) / 10 = feeBasisPoints
10000 + feeBasisPoints = 10 * feeBasisPoints
feeBasisPoints = 10000 / 9 â‰ˆ 1111
```

Therefore, to cap the fee at 10%, `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` should be set to approximately `1111` basis points.
