# Vouch can be increased even when the contract is paused

### Summary

Missing the modifier `whenNotPaused` allows the author of a vouch to increase their vouch count when the contract is in a paused state

### Root Cause

In [EthosVouch.sol:426](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426-L444) the function is missing the modifier `whenNotPaused` unlike most of the other functions. 
This allows the author of the vouch to increase their vouch even if the contract is in a paused state. 


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Contract is paused
2. Author of the vouch calls `increaseVouch()` function which Increases the amount staked for an existing vouch
3. Regardless of the contract being paused, the vouch is increased ie amount staked is increased

### Impact

Author of a vouch can increase their stakedAmount even when contract is paused

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the whenNotPaused modifier to the function

```diff
-  function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable nonReentrant {
+  function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
```
