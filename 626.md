### Summary

There is no slippage protection in sellVotes()

### Root Cause

### Attack Path

- Lets consider a scenario where user wants to execute transaction of sellVotes()
- And lets suppose there is a big amount transaction of sellVotes() prior to user's transaction.
- Now according to user he should be thinking he would get x amount of ETH but in this case due to prior big transaction of sellVotes() the price would come very low.
```solidity
 function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // calculate the amount of votes to sell and the funds received
    (
      uint256 votesSold,
      uint256 fundsReceived,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);

    // update the market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;

    // apply protocol fees
    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

    // send the proceeds to the seller
    _sendEth(fundsReceived);
    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
    emit VotesSold(
      profileId,
      msg.sender,
      isPositive,
      votesSold,
      fundsReceived,
      block.timestamp,
      minVotePrice,
      maxVotePrice
    );
    _emitMarketUpdate(profileId);
  }
```
- Now users sell transaction gets executed at low price which was not intended to him.
- As there was no slippage during sellToken() he would get very less ETH hence loss to user.

### Impact

Loss of users fund as if there is any prior big transaction it would affect user's selling price and they would get less amount of ETH

### Mitigation

Implement slippage like you did in buyVotes()
