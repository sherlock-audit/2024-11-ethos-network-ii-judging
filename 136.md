# Missing slippage control in `ReputationMarket::sellVotes`

### Summary

In `ReputationMarket`, users can buy and sell votes freely, either as a way of supporting profiles, or simply as a trade and arbitrage. `buyVotes` offers a parameter to do slippage control, in case of less votes are bought, but `sellVotes` doesn't have one, can cause users to lose some sold amount.

### Root Cause

We can see there is a slippage check in `buyVotes`:
```solidity
  function buyVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 expectedVotes,
    uint256 slippageBasisPoints
  ) public payable whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // Determine how many votes can be bought with the funds provided
    (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);

    _checkSlippageLimit(votesBought, expectedVotes, slippageBasisPoints);
```
But missing in [`sellVotes`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495C3-L499C64):
```solidity
function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
```

The reason behind slippage in buying votes is, for some market, the price of votes can be volatile, with the same ETH provided, less votes can be bought, but the root cause of this is due to rapid price change. The same thing can also happen when an user is selling votes, especially for normal markets, as the base votes are quite low, making it more possible to have fluctuating price. This will make user who is selling votes suffering slippage, and lose funds for the same amount of votes sold.
