# No gaps available in upgradeable contracts

### Summary

No gaps available in upgradeable contracts 

### Root Cause

Both EthosVouch and ReputationMarket are upgradeable contracts, this means that a Proxy contract will be used to keep the storage and use the logic in EthosVouch and ReputationMarket; the logic of these contracts can be upgraded by admin to enable more complex functionalities in the future.

However, AccessControl (from which EthosVouch and ReputationMarket inherit) and SignatureControl (from which AccessControl inherits) have no free gaps in their storage declarations. As a consequence, future implementations do not admit new state variables in these contracts without producing a storage collision.

### Attack Path

1. Admin upgrades EthosVouch or ReputationMarket to a new version using upgradeToAndCall() from UUPSUpgradeable, this new version contains new state variables in AccessControl and SignatureControl as its logic is more complex.
2. New state variables now point to storage slot occupied by different variables from the previous version, therefore a storage collision has been produced, totally altering the storage of the Proxy contract.

### Impact

Storage collision likely to happen when contract is upgraded. Serious limitations on new implementations to prevent the collision from happenning (no new state variables admitted in AccessControl and SignatureControl).

### Mitigation

Add  a gap in both mentioned contracts

```solidity
abstract contract AccessControl is
  IPausable,
  PausableUpgradeable,
  AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable,
  SignatureControl
{
  /**
   * @dev Constructor that disables initializers when the implementation contract is deployed.
   * This prevents the implementation contract from being initialized, which is important for
   * security since the implementation contract should never be used directly, only through
   * delegatecall from the proxy.
   */
  constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
  }
