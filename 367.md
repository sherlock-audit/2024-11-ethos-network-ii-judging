# Votes are sold at a lower price than the current vote price in the market which impacts price transparency

### Summary

In the `ReputationMarket::_calculateSell` function, the number of TRUST or DISTRUST votes are decremented by 1 first and then the price of the vote is calculated. This will result in a lower price than the current price of the vote in the market at which the user probably wants to trade. If the configuration is default with not much votes in the market for a profile then this will lower the price quite significantly than the actual price at which the user wanted to sell the votes.  

### Root Cause

Inside the `ReputationMarket::_calculateSell` function as the number of votes are decremented first therefore the price per vote decreases calculated in the next line (1037). This will result in the user getting less funds than expected. 

Although the user can simulate the sell first and get an idea about the funds one will get. But `simulateSell` also calls the `_calculateSell` function to determine the funds one will receive upon selling votes. 

For eg: in a default configuration market with votes (3 TRUST, 1 DISTRUST) the vote price will be:

votePrice of TRUST = (3 * 0.01)/4 = 0.0075

Now the user wants to sell 2 votes at the current price 0.0075 per vote.

But the actual price that will be used to sell his first vote will be 0.0066. In total the user will get 0.0066 + 0.005 = 0.0116 minus the protocol fee on top of 0.0116. Ideally the user should be getting 0.0075 + 0.0066 = 0.0141 minus protocol fee.

Not only this will question the tampering of the market price value at the protocol level but also when the protocol fee is calculated, it will be calculated on a lower amount and thus the protocol will receive less fee. For eg: Ideally the protocol should be getting some x% of 0.0141 but it will get x% of 0.0116.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

The attack path is natural as the price at which the user will be able to sell their votes will be 1 vote less than the actual price and will cause losses on selling.

### Impact

The protocol sells vote at a lower price than the actual which will impact the funds the user will receive upon selling, reputation of the protocol in keeping up with a fair pricing model and will result in receiving lower protocol fees. Since the number of votes will decrease on every sell, the lower the number of votes, the higher will be the volatility on price caused by every single vote sell.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Calculate the price before updating the number of votes inside the `_calculateSell` function.
```solidity
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
      fundsReceived += votePrice;
      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
```
