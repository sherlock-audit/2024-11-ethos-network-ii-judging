# `buyVote` function funds tracking vulnerability

## Summary
The current implementation of `marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid` includes the `protocolFee` and `donation`, even though these fees are redirected elsewhere (e.g., `protocol fees to a protocolFeeAddress` and `donations to donationEscrow`). This creates a discrepancy in accounting, as marketFunds[profileId] should ideally reflect only the funds directly related to the market and not include amounts sent elsewhere.

## Vulnerability Details
#### Issue: Incorrect Tallying of Funds in `marketFunds`
#### Description:
The `fundsPaid` variable includes `protocolFee` and `donation` in its calculation:
```solidity
fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;
```
This total is used to calculate the refund for the user, ensuring excess funds are returned. However, when adding `fundsPaid` to `marketFunds[profileId]`, the same total is used, which inaccurately inflates the `marketFunds` value with amounts already sent to other destinations:
```solidity
marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
```
Since `protocolFee` is sent to the `protocolFeeAddress` and `donation` is added to `donationEscrow`, these amounts should not be included in `marketFunds[profileId]`.

#### Root Cause:
Misalignment between the `fundsPaid` variable and the actual funds that should be attributed to `marketFunds[profileId]`.

## Impact
1. Overestimation of Market Funds: The `marketFunds` value is inflated by including the protocol fees and donations, which do not belong to the market. This could lead to incorrect assumptions about available market funds, especially during withdrawal or graduation processes.
2. Potential for Misuse or Exploitation: Misrepresenting market funds may open the door for unintended over-withdrawal during market graduation or other functions reliant on marketFunds.
3. Accounting Inconsistencies: The accounting logic is not aligned with the actual flow of funds, reducing clarity and increasing the risk of future bugs or misinterpretations.

## Recommendations
Modify the` marketFunds[profileId]` update to exclude `protocolFee` and `donation`:
```solidity
marketFunds[profileId] += (fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation);
```
