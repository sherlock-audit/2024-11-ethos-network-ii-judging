# Fee Management functions in EthosVouch can be called when the contract is paused.

### Summary

A missing modifier in every [Fee Management](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L557-L628) function allows every type of `FeeBasisPoint` to be changed while the contract is paused.

### Root Cause

Every Fee Management function can be called when the contract is paused.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. A Voucher wants to call `EthosVouch::vouchByAddress()`, `EthosVouch::vouchByProfileId()` or `EthosVouch::unvouch() `to vouch for a profile or unvouch as he likes the current fee condtions. 
2. The contract is paused.
3. While the contract is paused, the current `FeeBasisPoints` can be changed.
4. When the contract is unpaused, the fee conditions will be different and the user will not be able to vouch or unvouch for the same conditions.

### Impact

Users might not be able to vouch for the conditions they originally wanted to. Additionally, users may have to pay a higher exit fee as they can't unvouch when the contract is paused, but the `exitFeeBasisPoints` can be increased.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add `whenNotPaused` modifier to every Fee Management function in `EthosVouch.sol` just like in `ReputationMarket.sol`.
