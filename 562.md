# Corruptible Upgradibility Pattern in EthosVouch and ReputationMarket

### Summary

The usage of non-upgradeable `ReentrancyGuard` may introduce storage collissions if either the `EthosVouch` or `ReputationMarket` contract gets upgraded.


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L11

### Root Cause

Currently, OpenZeppelin has 2 reentrancy guard contracts:
- https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.sol
- https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol
As of now, the latter one (non-upgradeable) is used in the `EthosVouch` and `ReputationMarket` contracts.

### Internal pre-conditions

Either of the aforementioned contracts gets upgraded.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The projectâ€™s inheritance hierarchy is complex and extensively leverages multiple inheritance rather than a simple linear structure. This, combined with a reliance on proxy contracts for deployment, means that updating base contracts will be challenging, if not impossible. Further complicating this is the mixture of non-upgradable and upgradable base contracts from OpenZeppelin; some are from the standard OpenZeppelin library and define their own contract-level variables without supporting upgradability.

These factors create a fragmented upgradeability model, which may lead to significant issues when performing contract upgrades. Updating underlying contracts may lead to inconsistencies in the data stored in the proxy contract storage.

### PoC

This is the inheritance UML diagram of the `ReputationMarket` contract. The inheritance layout of the `EthosVouch` contract is corruptible, likewise.

    SignatureControl:::nostruct-->Initializable
```

### Mitigation

Use `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` instead, as it has proper storage gaps reserved.

Because it inherits from `Initializable`, whereas the simple (plain) `ReentrancyGuard` doesn't:
