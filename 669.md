# Admin's Funds Used When calling createMarketWithConfigAdmin

### Summary

uses admins msg.value to create the market and also sends the remaining funds to his address

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L301-L350

Since admin is calling the function ```createMarketWithConfigAdmin``` the msg.value is assigned to his address then there is a call to 
```_createMarket``` it creates the market and uses msg.value (admins funds) to do some processes and at the end it sends the ramining funds back to admins address  msg.value. It should use the marketOwner funds to do those stuff

```solidity
_sendEth(msg.value - initialLiquidityRequired);
```
