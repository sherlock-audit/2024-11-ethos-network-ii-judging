# both the in-scope contract are meant to be upgradable but inherit from the normal version of `ReentrancyGuard`

### Summary

both the in-scope contract are meant to be upgradable but inherit from the non-upgradable version of `ReentrancyGuard`. This is a big problem because if the contract is upgraded, the storage of `ReentracyGuard` will be messed up, leading to  unexpected behaviour or to `ReentracyGuard` functionality not working properly.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The `ReentrancyGuard` functionality won't work as intended.

Use `ReentrancyGuardUpgradable` instead of `ReentrancyGuard`. It has namespaced storage which will prevent this from happening
