# Vouching user could be charged 100% in fees amount

### Summary

[`EthosVouch::MAX_TOTAL_FEES`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120) constant value is set to `10000`. This is in basis points that is actually interpreted as 100% in computations. Which means that 100% of the user funds while vouching for any particular profile can be wiped out in the form of fees.

### Root Cause

First of all, in `EthosVouch::initialize` function, `entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints`, `entryDonationFeeBasisPoints`, `entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints`, and `exitFeeBasisPoints` are initialized without being checked against the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` cap.

Furthermore, contest details page mentioned:

For both contracts:
`Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%`

which means that `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` cap should be set at 10% (1000 bps) not 100% (10000 bps).

`EthosVouch::checkFeeExceedsMaximum` function will not revert until the total exceeds 100% fees amount.

```solidity
  function checkFeeExceedsMaximum(uint256 currentFee, uint256 newFee) internal view {
    uint256 totalFees = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints +
      exitFeeBasisPoints +
      entryDonationFeeBasisPoints +
      entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints +
      newFee -
      currentFee;
@>  if (totalFees > MAX_TOTAL_FEES) revert FeesExceedMaximum(totalFees, MAX_TOTAL_FEES);
  }
```

### Attack Path

1. A user calls `EthosVouch::vouchByProfileId` function, the total fees sum is set to 100%
2. The fees is applied and fees is sent to `protocolFeeAddress` and `toDeposit` amount becomes 0
3. `Vouch.balance` is `0` in this case
4. The user calls `EthosVouch::unvouch` function, because `Vouch.balance` was set to `0`, now as a resultant of `applyFees`, `toWithdraw` will also be zero, and nothing will be sent to `Voucher.authorAddress`

### Impact

As a result, user lost 100% of funds which he paid in the form of fees while vouched for an Ethos profile.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

`EthosVouch::MAX_TOTAL_FEES` should be set to `1000` not `10000`.

```diff
-- uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
++ uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000;
```
