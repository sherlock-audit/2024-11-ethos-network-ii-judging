# ReputationMarket charges an excessive protocol fee due to not excluding the refund amount

### Summary

In function `buyVotes`, the protocol charges protocol fee according to `msg.value`, but not all the `msg.value` is used to buy votes. Part of it will be refund. So the protocol charges an excessive protocol fee due to not excluding the refund amount. 

### Root Cause

In `buyVotes`, it will call `_calculateBuy` first.

And in `_calculateBuy`, it will call `previewFee` to calc protocol fee, and pass `msg.value` as amount.

```solidity
  function previewFees(
    uint256 amount,
    bool isEntry
  ) private view returns (uint256 funds, uint256 protocolFee, uint256 donation) {
    if (isEntry) {
      protocolFee = (amount * entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;
      donation = (amount * donationBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;
    } else {
      protocolFee = (amount * exitProtocolFeeBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;
    }
    funds = amount - protocolFee - donation;
  }
```
Actually, not all the `msg.value` is used to buy votes, part of `msg.value` will be refund.

The refund amount should not be charged a protocol fee.So the protocol charges an excessive protocol fee due to not excluding the refund amount.This issue is not by design according to the protocol team. 

For example: 
```solidity
With 0.2 ETH sent:
1. First vote costs 0.0999 ETH
2. Fees on full amount (0.2 ETH):
   - Protocol fee (5%): 0.01 ETH
   - Donation (5%): 0.01 ETH
   Total fees: 0.02 ETH

Funds available after fees = 0.18 ETH
First vote uses 0.0999 ETH
Remaining = 0.0801 ETH (gets refunded)
The protocol charged fees on the full 0.2 ETH but should have only charged on 0.0999 ETH
```
