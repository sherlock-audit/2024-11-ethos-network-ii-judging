# No Storage Gap for Upgradeable Contract Might Lead to Storage Slot Collision

**Vulnerability Details**
The AccessControl base contract is inherited in upgradeable contracts 
- [EthosVouch.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L67C1-L67C88)
-  [ReputationMarket](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L36))

Suppose storage variables are added to these base contracts without accounting for a storage gap towards the child contracts. In that case, a storage collision may cause contracts to malfunction and compromise other functionalities.

Storage Variable in AccessControl without considering storage gap!
```javascript
@>  IContractAddressManager public contractAddressManager;
```

**Recommended Mitigation**
Consider adding a [gap variable](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#storage_gaps) to future-proof base contract storage changes and be safe against storage collisions.

```diff
+ uint256[50] private __gap;
```
