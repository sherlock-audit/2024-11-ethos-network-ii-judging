# MAX_TOTAL_FEES Misconfiguration Allows Excessive Fee Charging Beyond Documented Limits


## Summary
The EthosVouch contract contains a critical misconfiguration where the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` constant is set to 10000 basis points (100%) instead of the documented maximum of 1000 basis points (10%). This discrepancy allows the protocol to potentially charge fees up to 100% of transaction values, violating the explicit specification in the documentation and potentially causing significant financial losses to users.

## Root Cause
The root cause is an implementation error in the EthosVouch.sol contract where the maximum fee limit constant is incorrectly set. While the documentation clearly states that "Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%", the contract implements this check using:
```solidity
uint256 public constant BASIS_POINT_SCALE = 10000;
uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000; // This allows 100% fees instead of 10%
```
This allows the total fees to be set up to 100% instead of the intended 10% maximum.

## Reference
- [README.md](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/README.md) 
- For both contracts: Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%
- [EthosVouch.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120) 
- Implementation of Total fee constant

## Proof of Concept
1. The contract uses basis points for fee calculations (1 basis point = 0.01%)
2. The `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` constant is set to 10000 basis points (100%)
3. The fee validation check allows any fee up to 100%:
```solidity
if (totalFees > MAX_TOTAL_FEES) revert FeesExceedMaximum(totalFees, MAX_TOTAL_FEES);
```
4. This allows admin to set combined fees that could total up to 100%, when they should be limited to 10%

## Internal pre-conditions
- Contract must be deployed
- Admin access to fee configuration functions

## External pre-conditions
None

## Attack Path
1. Admin sets entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints to 3400
2. Admin sets entryDonationFeeBasisPoints to 3300
3. Admin sets entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints to 3300
4. Total fees = 10000 basis points (100%)
5. This passes the MAX_TOTAL_FEES check despite exceeding documented limits

## Impact
High severity impact due to:
1. Direct violation of documented protocol specifications
2. Potential for significant financial losses to users
3. Risk of users paying up to 100% in fees when expecting maximum 10%
4. Loss of user trust and protocol reputation
5. Possible exploitation by malicious or compromised admin roles

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
1. Change the MAX_TOTAL_FEES constant to enforce the documented 10% limit:
```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000; // 10% in basis points
```
