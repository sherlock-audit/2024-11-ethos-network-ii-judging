# Reentrancy on graduate market withdrawal leaves contract vulnerable for draining

## Summary
Lack of `CEI` pattern or `nonRentrant` modifier protection on `ReputationMarket::withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()` leaves contract open to draining.

## Vulnerability Details
When a market has been graduated - the authorized graduation withdrawal address calls [withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L660-L678) to withdraw the market's funds, the problem lies in the following code:

```solidity
  function withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(uint256 profileId) public whenNotPaused {
    ...

    _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]); // @audit: can be reentered as this value is not zeroed earlier nor have a reentrancy protector
    emit MarketFundsWithdrawn(profileId, msg.sender, marketFunds[profileId]);
    marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
  }
```

The contract can be reentered as many times as necessary in order to drain the entire balance. While this can only be called by an authorized graduate withdrawal address which would limit the chances of an exploit to an extent, leaving such an open vulnerability in the contract could prove counter-intuitive.

## Impact
Entire contract balance can be drained through reentrancy by graduate withdrawal address.

## Recommendation
Either add a reentrancy modifier or simply change the order of operations:

```solidity
  function withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(uint256 profileId) public whenNotPaused {
    ...

    uint256 amount = marketFunds[profileId];
    marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
    _sendEth(amount);
    emit MarketFundsWithdrawn(profileId, msg.sender, marketFunds[profileId]);
  }
```
