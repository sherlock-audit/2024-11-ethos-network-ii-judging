# Inaccurate `marketFunds` update in `ReputationMarket::buyVotes` will makes the market funds not reflected correctly

### Summary

The function `buyVotes` updates `marketFunds` per profile ID by adding `fundsPaid`, which in this specific function includes the `protocolFee` and `donation` values. However, `marketFunds` should only consist of funds related to market activity.

### Root Cause

When calculating transaction using `_calculateBuy`, the returned [`fundsPaid`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L978) value are including the donation and protocol fees. This is an intended behavior because the user is supposed to send the `fundsPaid` to pay the votes, fees and donation.

The `applyFees` then would map the `donation` value to the profileId and for the `protocolFee` the amount are immediately sent to the protocol address fee.

This became problematic because at [line 481](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481) the `marketFunds` is added by `fundsPaid` where the value are including the donation and protocol fee.

The amount of `marketFunds` are inflated value because the protocol fee is already out of the contract balance and the donation is supposed to be separate funds to be claimed at later date.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

suppose fee for protocol and donation is 5% each
alice wants to buy votes profileId 1 owned by bob with 100 ether
with fee and donation calculated, alice should sent 110 ether `fundsPaid` to the contract
for the attack path, we isolate the amount to alice tx only so we can see how the discrepancy effected

1. alice call `buyVotes` for profileId 1 with 110 ether, actual contract balance = +110 ether
2. 5 ether immediately sent to the protocol fee address, actual contract balance = +105 ether
3. 5 ether mapped to bob's `donationEscrow` mapping
4. `marketFunds` of profileId 1 is now updated by +110 ether
5. bob withdraw the donation escrow, the contract sent 5 ether. actual contract balance = +100 ether
6. discrepancy of `marketFunds`: +110 ether vs actual +100 ether in contract

the discrepancy can be further continued by other user and/or when protocol calls `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` when doing graduate to a market.

### Impact

The total funds in the contract would be insufficient for all users to [sell](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L522) and for the protocol to [graduate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L675) the market.

The value of `donation` also double counted in the `marketFunds` and `donationEscrow`, where when user calls `witdhrawDonations` the value is coming from `donationEscrow` but the `marketFunds` are not deducted by same amount, this would cause inaccuracy of the `marketFunds` value.

Essentially, users would lose their funds. The above function can fails to send Ether because the actual Ether amount is less than the amount that reported by the `marketFunds`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

correct the logic when adding `marketFunds` in the `buyVotes` function:
