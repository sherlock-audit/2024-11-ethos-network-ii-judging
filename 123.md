# Users can bypass a significant amount of fees via `increaseVouch()`

### Summary

A sly user can bypass a significant amount of fees by instead of doing a single vouch for a subject profile id, he can split it into two steps, doing a partial vouch in the first, and doing the remaining vouch through `increaseVouch()` to get back a portion of the first vouch fee.

### Root Cause

Similar to `vouchByProfileId()`, the `increaseVouch()` function also uses the internal `applyFees()` function to perform the calculation and charge fee. Inside the `applyFees()` function, it calls the internal `_rewardPreviousVouchers()` function to perform the reward distribution to the early vouch authors of a given subject profile id. However, in the logic of this `_rewardPreviousVouchers()` function, there is no check to remove the previous vouch of `msg.sender` from `totalBalance` calculation and distribute rewards process, which results in the author receiving a reward for his previous vouch when performing increase vouch.

`_rewardPreviousVouchers` function:
```solidity
  function _rewardPreviousVouchers(
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 subjectProfileId
  ) internal returns (uint256 amountDistributed) {
    uint256[] storage vouchIds = vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId];
    uint256 totalVouches = vouchIds.length;

    // Calculate total balance of all active vouches
    uint256 totalBalance;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalVouches; i++) {
      Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];
      // Only include active (not archived) vouches in the distribution
      if (!vouch.archived) { // <- Auditor: Need to check the vouch's author
        totalBalance += vouch.balance;
      }
    }

    // If this is the first voucher, do not distribute rewards
    if (totalBalance == 0) {
      return totalBalance;
    }

    // Distribute rewards proportionally
    uint256 remainingRewards = amount;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalVouches && remainingRewards > 0; i++) {
      Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];
      if (!vouch.archived) { // <- Auditor: Need to check the vouch's author
        // Calculate this vouch's share of the rewards
        uint256 reward = amount.mulDiv(vouch.balance, totalBalance, Math.Rounding.Floor);
        if (reward > 0) {
          vouch.balance += reward;
          remainingRewards -= reward;
        }
      }
    }

    // Send any dust (remaining rewards due to rounding) to the subject reward escrow
    if (remainingRewards > 0) {
      _depositRewards(remainingRewards, subjectProfileId);
    }

    return amount;
  }
```

### Attack Path

For simple calculation, let's assume that:
- Currently there is only author A as the vouch author of subject B.
- Protocol fee point = donation fee point = 2.5%, vouchPool fee point = 5%

**Scene 1:** A vouches 10 ETH for B, 
- protocol fee = donation fee = 0.25 ETH, vouchPool fee = 0.5 ETH => **total fee = 1 ETH**
- actually deposit = 9 ETH

**Scene 2:**
- Step 1: A vouches 5 ETH for B, 
protocol fee = donation fee = 0.125 ETH, vouchPool fee = 0.25 ETH 
actually deposit = 4.5 ETH
- Step 2: After that he vouches 2nd (not calls vouch function, calls `increaseVouch` function) with 5 ETH for B, 
protocol fee = donation fee = 0.125 ETH, vouchPool fee = 0.25 ETH 
actually deposit = 4.5 ETH => total actually deposit = 9 ETH (equal to actually deposit in Scene 1)
But A will receive all 0.25 ETH from vouchPool for the previous vouching time  => **total fee = 0.75 ETH** => **bypass 0.25 ETH fee**

### Impact

Allowing users to bypass a portion of fee via the `increaseVouch()` action will reduce the actual reward of other users, causing implicit financial losses to other users. As confirmed by the Ethos technical dev team, this is a flaw and needs to be addressed to ensure fairness in fee and reward distribution.

### Mitigation

Check and exclude the address of the vouch/increaseVouch author from the calculation of the `_rewardPreviousVouchers` function.
