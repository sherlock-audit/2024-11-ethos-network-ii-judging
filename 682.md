# Donation Recipient Transfer multiple profileIds to newRecipient

### Summary

Current donationRecipient transfers all profileID's if he has multiple to the newRecipient

### Root Cause

when calling ```updateDonationRecipient``` and transfer the ```donationRecipients``` you dont specify which exactly profileID (market) you transfer to ```newRecipient``` and If the current ```donationRecipient``` has a lot of profileID's (markets) that he is current ```donationRecipition``` he transfers them all to the ```newRecipient```

and just an example look how you specify which exaclty profileID you transfer donations in ```applyFees```
