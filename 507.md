# Slashing timeLock not implemented and lets user about to be slashed unvouch all the vouches making slashing have no impact

### Summary

In the docs its stated that "_Any Ethos participant may act as a "whistleblower" to accuse another participant of inaccurate claims or unethical behavior. This accusation triggers a 24h lock on staking (and withdrawals) for the accused._ "
[Link to slashing docs](https://whitepaper.ethos.network/ethos-mechanisms/slash#slashing)

This timelock mechanishm is not implemented currently which lets the user unvouch thier entire vouches before they get slashed so as to make slashing the user have no impact.

### Root Cause

The slashing timlock mechanism for unvouching for slashing accused profiles is not implemented currently and there is over 24 hours timegap between the accusation and slashing so by that time the accused can unvouch all their vouches

```Solidity
function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
    _vouchShouldExist(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);
    // because it's $$$, you can only withdraw/unvouch to the same address you used to vouch
    // however, we don't care about the status of the address's profile; funds are always attached
    // to an address, not a profile
    if (vouches[vouchId].authorAddress != msg.sender) {
      revert AddressNotVouchAuthor(vouchId, msg.sender, vouches[vouchId].authorAddress);
    }

    v.archived = true;
    // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
    v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt = block.timestamp;
    // remove the vouch from the tracking arrays and index mappings
    _removeVouchFromArrays(v);

    // apply fees and determine how much is left to send back to the author
    (uint256 toWithdraw, ) = applyFees(v.balance, false, v.subjectProfileId);
    // set the balance to 0 and save back to storage
    v.balance = 0;
    // send the funds to the author
    // note: it sends it to the same address that vouched; not the one that called unvouch
    (bool success, ) = payable(v.authorAddress).call{ value: toWithdraw }("");
    if (!success) {
      revert FeeTransferFailed("Failed to send ETH to author");
    }

    emit Unvouched(v.vouchId, v.authorProfileId, v.subjectProfileId);
  }
```

The accused user can just call unvouch() for all their vouches making slashing have no impact


### Impact

There is over 24 hours timegap between the profile accusation and slashing and by that time the accused can unvouch all their vouches making slashing have no impact



### Mitigation

Implement a function that can be called in EthosVouch where once an accusation is raised for a particular profile the function will flag the user profile and add checks in unvouch() to check if the profile is flagged before the user can unvouch

```Solidity
 mapping(uint256 => bool) public isProfileAccused;
```

```Solidity
  function accuseProfile(uint256 profileId, bool accuse) external {
   isProfileAccused[profileId] = accuse;
  }
```
and add these validations in unvouch()

```Solidity
    uint256 profileId = IEthosProfile(
      contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
    ).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);

    require(!isProfileAccused[profileId],"Cannot Unvouch Profile accused");
```
