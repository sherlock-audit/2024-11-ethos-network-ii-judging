### Attack Path

- During `buyVotes()` the user who's buying is charged a protocol fees and then these fees goes to `protocolFeeAddress`
- There is two times accounting of protocol fees done inside `buyVotes()`
- Firstly the protocolFeeAddress gets the fee value which is coming from _calculateBuy()
```solidity
(
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);
    _checkSlippageLimit(votesBought, expectedVotes, slippageBasisPoints);

    // Apply fees first
    applyFees(protocolFee, donation, profileId);
```
- Then at the end of function there is accounting done for `marketFunds` where they are adding `fundsPaid` into marketFunds depicting that how many native token are there in contract for this profileId
```solidity
marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
```
- There is a bug here as `fundsPaid` variable which is coming from _calculateBuy() includes both `votePrice` and `protocolFee`
```solidity
while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
      fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
@ --> fundsPaid += votePrice;
      votesBought++;

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    }
@ --> fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;
```
- So basically during `marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;` the protocol adds both votePrice as well as protocolFee but actually it should only add votePrice value as protocolFee has been already transferred to protocolFeeAddress.
- So after this function the contract address only has `votePrice` amount of eth for this profile id but actually during accounting it include `votePrice + protocolFees`


### Impact

- As there is two times accounting of fees so during `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()` native token gets transferred with amount as `marketFunds[profileId]`.
`_sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]);`
- So there will be accounting issue as native token transferred from buyVotes()for this profileId would be less than the value which is stored in `marketFunds[profileId]`.
- This implies during withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds if there are any extra native token in the contract the extra native token would be transferred from the contract which eventually would create with other users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Implement it like these
` marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation;`
