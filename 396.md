# Missing Slippage Protection Will Lose Funds Of Users When Selling Votes

### Summary

The missing slippage protection in `ReputationMarket.sol:495` will cause loss of funds for users trying to sell their votes in the case of a price movement.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L534

### Root Cause

In `ReputationMarket.sol:495` there is a missing slippage protection parameter and check which means that the `sellVotes` function is not protected for receiving less votes in the case of a price movement.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There should be a sudden price movement caused either maliciously or not.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User A calls `simulateSell` to see the effect of him selling a given amount of votes.
2. There is a sudden price movement.
3. User A calls `sellVotes` thinking it will have either the same or similar effect to the call of `simulateSell`.
4. User A sells votes basically on a discount without having the proper control to prevent it.

### Impact

User loses by selling votes on a discount without having the proper control to prevent it.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a slippage parameter and check in the `sellVotes` function similar to the one already implemented in the `buyVotes` function.
