# Potential Misconfiguration of Donation Basis Points

### Summary

At raputationMarket.sol. The setDonationBasisPoints function allows an administrator to set the percentage of donations, expressed in basis points, with a maximum of 500 (5%). It ensures that the input does not exceed the defined MAX_DONATION_BASIS_POINTS but does not explicitly check for a zero value.

### Root Cause

In raputationMarket.sol l593 The lack of a 0 basis points check could lead to, since the donation percentage is 0, no donations would be deducted or allocated. This effectively disables the donation. This is a logic vulnerability and should be restricted. The function should include a minimum value check to prevent this misconfiguration.

### Internal pre-conditions

The function setDonationBasisPoints is called.
basisPoints is set to 0.
No explicit zero-value check exists in the function logic.

### External pre-conditions

The caller is an administrator with the necessary privileges.
The contract is not paused.

### Attack Path

An admin sets basisPoints to 0 through setDonationBasisPoints.
Donation deductions are effectively disabled due to zero percentage allocation.
Donations meant for specific purposes (e.g., funding or incentives) are not collected, disrupting the intended operation.

### Impact

Revenue Disruption: No donations are collected, potentially halting funding for critical activities.

### PoC

// Deploy the contract and call the following:
contract.setDonationBasisPoints(0);

// Expected Behavior:
- Donations are no longer collected during transactions.
- Any functionality dependent on the donation mechanism is disrupted.
