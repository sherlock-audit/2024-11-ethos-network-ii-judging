# Double Accounting of Fees will lead to an Inflated marketFunds

### Summary

The `marketFunds` in `ReputationMarket::buyVotes()` includes fees (protocol fees and donations) that have already been distributed via `applyFees()`, resulting in an inflated accounting of the market's funds.

### Root Cause

In the `_calculateBuy`, protocolFee and donation are added to fundsPaid. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L978C2-L978C41
```solidity
fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;
```

This addition is necessary to compute the `refund`. However, notice that `protocolFees` and `donation` are already distributed via `applyFees`. Despite this, `marketFunds` is then updated with the full `fundsPaid` amount which incorrectly includes the already distributed fees.

```solidity
 function buyVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 expectedVotes,
    uint256 slippageBasisPoints
  ) public payable whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // Determine how many votes can be bought with the funds provided
    (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
@>  ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);

    _checkSlippageLimit(votesBought, expectedVotes, slippageBasisPoints);

    // Apply fees first
@>  applyFees(protocolFee, donation, profileId); // @audit - fees are already distributed

    // Update market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += votesBought;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += votesBought;

    // Add buyer to participants if not already a participant
    if (!isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender]) {
      participants[profileId].push(msg.sender);
      isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = true;
    }

    // Calculate and refund remaining funds
    uint256 refund = msg.value - fundsPaid;
    if (refund > 0) _sendEth(refund);

    // tally market funds
@>  marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid; // @audit - fees are included
```

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The `marketFunds` shows an inflated balance that includes already distributed fees. When a market graduates and funds are withdrawn through `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()`, the contract attempts to withdraw more funds than it should have. This could also lead to failed withdrawals because the contract balance will be insufficient.


### PoC

### Mitigation

Subtract fees when adding to marketFunds:
```diff
    // tally market funds
-   marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
+   marketFunds[profileId] += (fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation);
```
