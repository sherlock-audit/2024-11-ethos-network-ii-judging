# README is not followed when it comes to fee receiver

### Summary

As stated in the README the fee address should not be trusted
> Fee receiver should not have any additional access (beyond standard users), though if the fee receiver is set to owner/admin that's fine.

This implies that the fee address can be any address and **should not** have any privileges above that of a normal user.

However currently the fee receiver has more privileges than a normal user, as it can control when `applyFees` works and when it doesn't. That's because `applyFees` executes an arbitrary call to that address, from where on the address can re-ender and use a flash-loan to vouch and claim a huge part of the rewards or DOS the function (by reverting it).

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L941-L943
```solidity
      if (protocolFee > 0) {
        _depositProtocolFee(protocolFee);
      }
```

When we consider that `applyFees` is used in all core functions - `vouchByProfileId`,  `increaseVouch` and `unvouch` we can see that the address receiving the funds has a huge control over the contract.

### Root Cause

Fee receiver being called mid function inside `applyFees`

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Any user calls `unvouch`
2. Fee receiver does not want that vouch to be reduced, so he reverts the call
3. User is unable to reduce his vouch

### Impact

README states that the fee receiver should not have any privileges above a normal user, however that's not true as that address can control all core functions and choose who can vouch for who.

> Fee receiver should not have any additional access (beyond standard users), though if the fee receiver is set to owner/admin that's fine.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Instead of sending the funds directly to the fee receiver, increase `rewards` and allow them to claim. 


```diff
  function _depositProtocolFee(uint256 amount) internal {
-    (bool success, ) = protocolFeeAddress.call{ value: amount }("");
-    if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Protocol fee deposit failed");
+    rewards[protocolFeeAddress] += amount
  }
```
