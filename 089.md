# Vouch amount can be lower than minimum

### Summary

When vouching the minimum vouch amount  must be >= ABSOLUTE_MINIMUM_VOUCH_AMOUNT (0.0001 ether), however, it can be lower than that as the validation is not sufficient.

### Root Cause

In [vouchByProfileId:380](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L380) it is validated that `msg.value` is not lower than the minimum vouch amount, however, the actual vouch amount will always be less than `msg.value` due to the fees. Therefore, it is possible for the `msg.value` to be higher than the minimum, whilst the actual vouch is not.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `vouchByProfileId` is called with `msg.value = ABSOLUTE_MINIMUM_VOUCH_AMOUNT`
2. 10% of the ETH is deducted due to the fees, and the amount of the vouch lowers below the minimum

### Impact

An important invariant of the protocol is broken.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Validate whether `toDeposit` is not lower than `ABSOLUTE_MINIMUM_VOUCH_AMOUNT`.
