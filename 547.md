# Incorrect Accounting of `marketFunds[profileId]` Leads to Insufficient Funds for Withdrawals via `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()`

### Summary

The accounting mechanism of the contract where users are unable to withdraw their funds due to incorrect accounting of `marketFunds[profileId]`.

### Root Cause
The root cause of the issue is that the `protocolFee` and `donation` are not deducted from `marketFunds[profileId]`, leading to a discrepancy between the recorded funds and the actual contract balance.

Affected code: 
ReputationMarket.sol#L481

### Attack Path

1. User sends 10 ETH to buy votes.
    * `protocolFee` = 1 ETH, `donation` = 1 ETH
    * `fundsPaid` = 10 ETH
    * `applyFees` deducts 2 ETH (1 ETH protocol fee + 1 ETH donation) and sends them to respective addresses.
    * `marketFunds[profileId]` += 10 ETH
2. Accounting after buying votes
    * `marketFunds[profileId]` == 10 ETH
    * Actual contract balance == 8 ETH because 2 ETH were sent to respective addresses already.
3. User attempts to withdraw funds
    * User calls `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()`
    * The function attempts to withdraw 10 ETH (as recorded in marketFunds).
    * The contract only has 8 ETH available.
    * The `_sendEth()` function fails due to insufficient funds.

### Impact

1. Users will unable to withdraw funds due to insufficient funds caused by incorrect accounting of `marketFunds[profileId]` via `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()`

2. This function deducts `fundsReceived` from `marketFunds`. If `marketFunds` is overstated, this deduction may not accurately reflect the actual funds available, potentially leading to inconsistencies.

### Mitigation

We recommend removing the protocol fee and donation from the `marketFunds[profileId]` in `buyVotes()` function to ensure accurate accounting and prevent withdrawal failures.
