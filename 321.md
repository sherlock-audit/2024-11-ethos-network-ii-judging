# `ReputationMarket.buyVotes()` : users can buy votes for zero price when the market has a large difference between the trust and distrust votes (has higher votes for one type than the other type), due to rounding down in `_calcVotePrice()`

### Summary

`ReputationMarket._calcVotePrice()` can return a zero price for a vote if the other vote type is much greater than the bought type , ex: a market with trust votes much greater than the distrust votes results in calculating zero price for distrust votes.

### Root Cause

The sum of trust vote + distrust vote should equal to the `market.basePrice`, but due to rounding down in price calculation in [`_calcVotePrice()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L922) (truncation); vote price of the less bought type can be zero.

### Internal pre-conditions

- `ReputationMarket.buyVotes()` enables users to buy votes from an active market, where they send their txn with a `msg.value`, then the protocol fees and donation fees are calculated as percentages from the sent `msg.value`, then the remaining amount is used to buy votes.
- The calculation of fees and number of bougth votes are handled by [`_calculateBuy()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L942):

```javascript
function _calculateBuy(
    Market memory market,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 funds
  )
    private
    view
    returns (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      uint256 newVotePrice,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    )
  {
    uint256 fundsAvailable;
    (fundsAvailable, protocolFee, donation) = previewFees(funds, true);
    uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);

    uint256 minPrice = votePrice;
    uint256 maxPrice;

    if (fundsAvailable < votePrice) {
      revert InsufficientFunds();
    }

    while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
      fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
      fundsPaid += votePrice;
      votesBought++;

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    }
    fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;

    maxPrice = votePrice;

    return (votesBought, fundsPaid, votePrice, protocolFee, donation, minPrice, maxPrice);
  }
```

- `_calcVotePrice()` is called in each loop to calculate the updated vote price, where the price of the vote that's going to be bought will increase with each loop:

```javascript
  function _calcVotePrice(Market memory market, bool isPositive) private pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalVotes = market.votes[TRUST] + market.votes[DISTRUST];
    return (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] * market.basePrice) / totalVotes;
  }
```

- As can be noticed, the price of a vote type depends on the number of that type and the total votes of both types, so if there's a market with 100 trust votes and 5 distrust votes, and assuming the `basePrice` is 10, then:
- the price of trust vote = `100 * 10 / (100+5) = 9` (9.52 rounded down to 9)
- the price of distrust vote = `5 * 10 / (100+5) = 0` (0.47 rounded down to 0)

So there are two issues with this function:

- it can return a zero vote price if the bought vote is of the lesser bought type.
- the sum of trust vote + distrust vote price doesn't sum-up to the `market.basePrice` due to rounding down.

- So with this truncation on price (due to rounding-down); the total price of bought trust votes + the total price of the bought distrust votes will be **less than** the total number of bought votes (excluding initial votes) \* basePrice.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Users buying from a market that has heavy votes on one side (trust or distrust) can buy votes of the other type (the less bought type) with zero price.
2. Then these users can sell their votes when the vote type they bought increased, so that they can make a profit from selling these votes without actually paying any price when they bought it.


### Impact

- Users buying from a market that has heavy votes on one side (trust or distrust) can buy votes of the other type (the lesser bought type) with zero price -to some extent- (as long as the less bought vote type price rounds down to zero), so users can profit from this by selling their zero-price votes with higher price when that bought type votes increase.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update `_calcVotePrice()` to ensure that the sum of trust + distrust vote adds up to `basePrice`, so that users can't buy votes of the less bought type with zero (lesser) price, so as per the aforementioned given example:

- the price of trust vote = `100 * 10 / (100+5) = 9` (9.52 rounded down to 9).
- the price of distrust vote = `10 - price of trust vote = 10 - 9 = 1`.
