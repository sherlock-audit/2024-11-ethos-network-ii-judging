# Inaccurate marketFunds Updates in ReputationMarket Contract

### Summary

 This is issue is as a result of an improper management of market funds, where the protocol fees (entry and exit) and donation fees are not deducted when funds are added or removed from the marketFunds variable. As a result, the marketFunds for each profile grows beyond the actual available balance of the contract, leading to failures in fund withdrawal logic.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the incorrect calculation and storage of market funds. After buying votes, the fees (protocol and donation) are deducted from the total funds but are not reflected in the market funds storage variable, causing an inflated market funds balance.

 Similarly, when selling votes, the protocol and exit fees are not properly deducted from the market funds, resulting in an incorrect market funds balance. This leads to a mismatch between the actual contract balance and the recorded market funds.

However, withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds function assums that marketFunds[profileId] represents the actual available funds for that profile. However, the funds are inflated due to the contract's failure to properly deduct protocol and donation fees when updating market funds.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. marketFunds is updated directly using the total fundsPaid or fundsReceived without deducting protocol and donation fees.
2. No mechanism exists to reconcile marketFunds with the actual contract balance.

### External pre-conditions

1. Admins sets the fees i.e (entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints, exitProtocolFeeBasisPoints, donationBasisPoints).
2. A user buys or sells votes using the buyVotes or sellVotes functions.
3. Withdrawal of graduated market funds is attempted using withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds.
4. One or Multiple active markets exist, with overlapping fund usage and withdrawal scenarios.

### Attack Path

1. User interacts with the buyVotes function, leading to overestimation of marketFunds for the specific profile.
2. User then withdraws graduated market funds for this profile, depleting funds that should be available for active markets even further.
3, Attempt to withdraw funds from the markets leads to a failure due to insufficient balance.

### Impact

1. Contract-wide fund mismanagement: Overestimated marketFunds allows one market to deplete funds intended for others.

2. Reversion in critical functions: Withdrawals (withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds, sellVotes, withdrawDonations) fail due to insufficient contract balance.

This will ultimately lead to loss of funds

### PoC

paste into contracts/test/reputationMarket/rep.market.test.ts

```solidity
 describe("my own test", () => {
    it('cybrid test', async () => {
      const entryFee = 200;
      const exitFee = 300;
      const donationFee = 100;
      const protocolFeeAddress = ethers.Wallet.createRandom().address;

      await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setProtocolFeeAddress(protocolFeeAddress);
      await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints(entryFee);
      await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setDonationBasisPoints(donationFee);
      await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setExitProtocolFeeBasisPoints(exitFee);

     
      //buying ..
      const buyAmount = ethers.parseEther('0.1');
      const { simulatedVotesBought } = await userA.simulateBuy({ buyAmount });
      await reputationMarket
        .connect(userA.signer)
        .buyVotes(DEFAULT.profileId, DEFAULT.isPositive, simulatedVotesBought, 1n, {
          value: buyAmount,
        });

        let marketFunds = await reputationMarket.marketFunds(DEFAULT.profileId);
        let reputationMarketBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(reputationMarket);



        //issue1. After buying, when updating the marketFunds storage variable, the total fees where not removed from the fundsPaid
        //hence, this updates the marketFunds with funds that that has already been transfered to the protocolFeeAddress and the one added to the donationEscrow of the recipient
        // this the lead to the marketfunds of each profile Id greater than the contract balance 
        // marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid
        // actualBalance += fundsPaid - protocolfee
        console.log("market funds", marketFunds, reputationMarketBalance); //marketFunds[profileId]=111967893217893214n, balance = 109967893217893214n



        //selling
        const { simulatedVotesSold } =
        await userA.simulateSell({ sellVotes: DEFAULT.sellVotes });
        await reputationMarket
        .connect(userA.signer)
        .sellVotes(DEFAULT.profileId, DEFAULT.isPositive, simulatedVotesSold);

         marketFunds = await reputationMarket.marketFunds(DEFAULT.profileId);
         reputationMarketBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(reputationMarket);

         //issue2: same thing happens in selling as the update goes thus
         //marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
        // actualBalance -= fundsReceived + exitfee;
        // Further making marketFunds[profileId] increase over actualBalance
         console.log("market funds", marketFunds, reputationMarketBalance); //marketFunds[profileId]=30519036796536796n, balance = 26000000000000000n


        
        // however, this is not expected in the withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds functions as it attempts to withdraw an amount of marketFunds[profileId].
        // This is with the assumption that marketFunds reflect the funds for each market in the contract, and it dosen't consider the fees
        // This will then lead the revertion due to attempt to withdraw an amount greater than the balance of the contract. 

        await deployer.contractAddressManager.contract
        .connect(deployer.OWNER)
        .updateContractAddressesForNames([deployer.ADMIN.address], ['GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL']);

        await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).graduateMarket(DEFAULT.profileId)

        await expect(
          reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(DEFAULT.profileId)
        ).to.be.revertedWith("ETH transfer failed");


        
        //This will flow through in a situation where there are more than one market which will lead to stealing funds from the yet to be graduated market
        //e.g 
        // Marketfunds[profileId1] = 2 ether,   actualBalance = 1.5 ether
        // Marketfunds[profileId2] = 1.5 ether, actualBalance = 1 ether
        // Total =                   3.5 ether, actualBalance = 2 ether

        // withdrawing GraduatedMarketFunds market of profileId1 will lead to the deduction of 2 ether stealing additional 0.5 ether, leaving the funds available to only 0.5 ether
        // Any attempt to withdraw GraduatedMarketFunds for profileId2 will then lead to ETH transfer failed error as the funds is not up to 1.5 ether


        // This will also lead to issues in many other functions that withdraw funds from the reputationMarket contract such as 
        //sellVotes i.e it will revert if there is no enough funds
        // withdrawDonations i.e graduating market does not take this into consideration, as it attempts to withdraw it all. Hence, this will revert due to lack of funds


     
    });
  })


```

### Mitigation

1. Adjust marketFunds Update Logic: Exclude protocol, donation, and exit fees when updating marketFunds.
i.e in buyVotes
```solidity
- marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
+ marketFunds[profileId] += (fundsPaid - protocolFee - donationFee);
```

in sellVotes
```solidity
- marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
+ marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived + protocolFee;
```

2. Implement another another logic so withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds does not use marketFunds[profileId] as the withdrawal amount
