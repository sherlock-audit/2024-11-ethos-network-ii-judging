# Wrong calculation of marketFunds leads to losses for other markets.

### Summary

Wrong calculation of `marketFunds`  - this variable includes not only funds from bought votes, but also donations to owners and protocol fees, which does not exists in the contract balance at all.

> 

### Root Cause

[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481)

Variable `fundsPaid` includes both market funds from bought votes and fees:
```solidity
  fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;
```

Variable `marketFunds[profileId]` should track only market funds, because fees belongs to market's owner and protocol, but it increases by full amount spent by user:
```solidity
    // Calculate and refund remaining funds
    uint256 refund = msg.value - fundsPaid;
    if (refund > 0) _sendEth(refund);

    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
```

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Some details are omitted for simplicity:
- Owner creates market:
```solidity
marketFunds[profileId] = initialLiquidityRequired = 100 ETH
donationEscrow[donationRecipient[marketOwnerProfileId]] = 0 ETH
address(this).balance = 100 ETH
```
- Users bought votes for 100 ETH, they also paid 5 ETH as donations and 3 ETH as entry fees:
```solidity
marketFunds[profileId] = 100 ETH + 107 ETH (fundsPaid) = 207 ETH
donationEscrow[donationRecipient[marketOwnerProfileId]] = 5 ETH
address(this).balance = 100 ETH + 105 ETH = 205 ETH
```
- Real balance of contract is 205 ETH, because 3 ETH as entry fees were sent to `protocolFeeAddress`. 
- Market was graduated;
- Owner can claim 5 ETH as donations in `withdrawDonations()`, but `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` will always revert because `address(this).balance (200 ETH) < marketFunds[profileId] = 207 ETH`. It breaks the invariant `The vouch and vault contracts must never revert a transaction due to running out of funds.`
- If there are other markets, then both transactions will be successfully executed, but funds will be stolen from liquidity of other markets. It breaks the invariant  `They must never pay out the initial liquidity deposited. The only way to access those funds is to graduate the market.`

### Impact

Wrong calculation inflates `marketFunds[profileId]`, leading to unability to withdraw market funds, or to stealing them from other markets.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change `buyVotes()` function:
```diff
-   marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
+   marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation;
```
