# Incorrect modification of `marketFunds` in the `ReputationMarket.buyVotes()` function.

### Summary

`marketFunds` represents the net amount without fees. However, in the `buyVotes()` function, `marketFunds` is incremented by `fundsPaid`, which includes the fee amount.

### Root Cause

As shown in [line 481](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481) of the `buyVotes()` function, `marketFunds` is incremented by `fundsPaid`.

```solidity
       function buyVotes(
         ...

         (
           uint256 votesBought,
453:       uint256 fundsPaid,
           ,
           uint256 protocolFee,
           uint256 donation,
           uint256 minVotePrice,
           uint256 maxVotePrice
         ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);
     
         ...

481:     marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
         
         ...
       }
```

`fundsPaid` is calculated in the `_calculateBuy()` function. However, as you can see in [line 978](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L978), `fundsPaid` includes fees.

```solidity
       function _calculateBuy(
         ...

978:     fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;

         ...
       }
```

`marketFunds` represents the refund amount when withdrawing graduate market funds, so it should not include fees that were already paid to the protocol and for donations.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

Incorrect modification of `marketFunds` results in a loss of funds for the protocol when withdrawing from the graduate market funds.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Exclude fees when modifying `marketFunds`.

```diff
       function buyVotes(
         ...

         (
           uint256 votesBought,
           uint256 fundsPaid,
           ,
           uint256 protocolFee,
           uint256 donation,
           uint256 minVotePrice,
           uint256 maxVotePrice
         ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);
     
         ...

-        marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
+        marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation;
         
         ...
       }
```
