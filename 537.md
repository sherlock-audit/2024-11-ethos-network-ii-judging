# Plausible Inflated Fee Calculation in _calculateBuy Function

### Summary

The _calculateBuy function in the ReputationMarkets.sol  charges an inflated fee in scenarios where msg.value is significantly greater than the normal price. This issue arises due to an error in handling fees for users and thereby leading to overcharging users.
This vulnerability is feasible because the buyVotes() function which is utilized by users in buying votes accepts an arbitrary value which might be substantially greater than the amount needed  to buy a vote.

### Root Cause

Root Cause is in the _calculateBuy() method, which calculates protocol fees and donation fees based on msg.value sent buy a user to buy votes.

Previewfees below calculates fees based on deposited amount which can sometimes be larger than the required amount for a vote.

```solidity


(fundsAvailable, protocolFee, donation) = previewFees(fund, true); //fund parameter which is arbitrary msg.value
````
The function previewFees calculates fees based on msg.value, which can result in inflated fees if msg.value is significantly higher than the expected amount. This can lead to users being overcharged for their transactions.


The buy vote function where _calculate buy is called 

```solidity

  function buyVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 expectedVotes,
    uint256 slippageBasisPoints
  ) public payable whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // Determine how many votes can be bought with the funds provided
    (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);//msg.value might be //substantially greater than amount needed

```

### Internal pre-conditions

-The function relies on msg.value for fee calculation, which can be substantially higher than the normal expected to buy a vote.
-There are no off-chain checks to ensure msg.value is within expected range

### External pre-conditions

-Users can send any msg.value they choose, which can be significantly higher than the normal price.
-The platform does not enforce a maximum limit on msg.value, allowing for potential exploitation.

### Attack Path

A user is exploited in this vulnerability when they are sending significantly higher msg.value than required, causing the function to calculate and charge an inflated fee on them . This can lead to excessive fees being deducted from the user's funds.

### Impact

This vulnerability is dependent on user input but since there are no checks from the protocol to ensure that the user input is within expected range for the purchase of a vote,  impact is high as users are charged excessively in fees in  cases where they make substantial deposit thereby leading to loss of user funds

### PoC

BuyVotes() when called by a user basically calculates protocol fees and donation fees directly on msg.value, and can vary depending on the amount deposited by a user. 

Let's take the example of user Bob who attempts to buy one vote(either trust/distrust),  user Bob however doesn't know the price of the vote they intend to buy (N.b: users may not be privy to current price as price of trust and distrust vote vary depending on the amount present per market).
They however go ahead to  deposit an arbitrary amount that is substantially greater than the normal range.

The _calculateBuy function however instead of calculating fees based on the price of one vote, calculates the protocol and donation fees based on the amount deposited by user Bob before evaluating the amount to be returned to user Bob.

This leads to user Bob incurring greater fees on the purchase of a vote than is normally expected.



### Mitigation

To fix the issue, ensure that the fee calculation is based on the actual required amount rather than msg.value. This will ensure that the price of the vote that the user intends to buy(either trust/distrust) is calculated initially, which is then used to calculate protocol fees and donations fees after which excess amounts are evaluated and sent back to user.

The updated code should include a validation to check and adjust the fee calculation accordingly based on normally required amount before previewFees is called. For example:

```solidity

++uint256 requiredFunds = calculateRequiredFunds(market, isPositive, funds);
(fundsAvailable, protocolFee, donation) = previewFees(requiredFunds, true);
```

This ensures that the fees are calculated based on the actual required funds, preventing inflated fees due to excessive msg.value.
