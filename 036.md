# Possible storage collision during upgrade

### Summary

Such as `ReputationMarket.sol` it is recommend to use `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` instead of `ReentrancyGuard` and make `__ReentrancyGuard_init()` in `initialize`  function. It is need such as ReentrancyGuard contract stores variable `_status` in the state, so id new version of the contract will be have another inheritance layout it may cause of the storage collision. 

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket.sol:36](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L36C62-L36C77) is inheritance from ReentrancyGuard instead of ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable
