# Users will be able to increase their Vouch when contract is paused.

### Summary

The `increaseVouch()` function is missing the `whenNotPaused` modifier which causes anyone to be able to increase their vouch even when the contract is paused.

### Root Cause

In [`EthosVouch.sol:426`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426) the function `increaseVouch()` is missing the `whenNotPaused` modifier.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `EthosVouch` contract has to be paused by the `InteractionControl`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A User calls `increaseVouch()` while the contract is paused.

### Impact

The desired functionality of the contract is that this function does not allow being called when the contract is paused. However since the modifier is missing, the function can be called anyways. This could for example lead to an user increasing their vouch but then not being able to unvouch anymore since the contract is paused. The contract would as well apply fees to the transaction which also should not happen while it is paused.

### PoC

```solidity
  it('should successfully increase vouch amount when paused', async () => {
    const { vouchId, balance } = await userA.vouch(userB, { paymentAmount: initialAmount });

    const protocolFeeAmount = calculateFee(increaseAmount, entryFee).fee;
    const donationFeeAmount = calculateFee(increaseAmount, donationFee).fee;
    const expectedDeposit = increaseAmount - protocolFeeAmount - donationFeeAmount;
    deployer.interactionControl.contract.pauseAll(); //pausing the contract here
    await deployer.ethosVouch.contract
      .connect(userA.signer)
      .increaseVouch(vouchId, { value: increaseAmount });

    const finalBalance = await userA.getVouchBalance(vouchId);
    expect(finalBalance).to.be.closeTo(balance + expectedDeposit, 1n);
  });
  ```

### Mitigation

Add the `whenNotPaused` modifier to `increaseVouch()`.
