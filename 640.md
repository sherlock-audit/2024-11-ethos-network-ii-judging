# Max total fees are set to 100%, instead of the stated 10%

### Summary

Despite what was intended, the MAX_TOTAL_FEES are currently set to `100%`, instead of `10%` in spite of README's claims:
> For both contracts:
> Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%

### Root Cause

As you can see, `10000 / 10000` is a whole `1`,

It should have been `1000 / 10000`, if `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` was set to `1000` instead.

```solidity
  uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
  uint256 public constant BASIS_POINT_SCALE = 10000;
  uint256 public constant MAX_SLASH_PERCENTAGE = 1000;
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The issue is conceptual.

### Impact

Considering the new admin rule, the admin doesn't know initially that the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` variable has a wrong value.

This check will never pop up on time when fees exceed 10%:
```solidity
  /* @notice Checks if the new fee would cause the total fees to exceed the maximum allowed
   * @dev This function is called before updating any fee to ensure the total doesn't exceed MAX_TOTAL_FEES
   * @param currentFee The current value of the fee being updated
   * @param newFee The proposed new value for the fee
   */
  function checkFeeExceedsMaximum(uint256 currentFee, uint256 newFee) internal view {
    uint256 totalFees = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints +
      exitFeeBasisPoints +
      entryDonationFeeBasisPoints +
      entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints +
      newFee -
      currentFee;
    if (totalFees > MAX_TOTAL_FEES) revert FeesExceedMaximum(totalFees, MAX_TOTAL_FEES);
  }

```

The error will only be triggered when the fees exceed 100% of the total amount / quantity of fees.

### Mitigation

```diff
- uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
+ uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000;
  uint256 public constant BASIS_POINT_SCALE = 10000;
  uint256 public constant MAX_SLASH_PERCENTAGE = 1000;
```
