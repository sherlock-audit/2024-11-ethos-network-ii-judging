# users funds loss and/or transaction reverts due to insufficient Eth balance in ReputationMarket contract

### Summary

In current ReputationMarket contract logic, marketFunds[profileId] state variable was wrongly updated in ReputationMarket::sellVotes function.Due to which exitProtocolFee was wrongly collecting twice from the contract.
1)while selling the votes
2)while withdrawing GraduatedMarketFunds
due to which future transactions revert due to insufficient Eth balance therefore users loss funds.



### Root Cause

If users want to sell votes then they will call ReputationMarket::sellVotes function
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495
Then it internally calls _calculateSell function which calculates and return votesSold,fundsReceived,protocolFee,minVotePrice,maxVotePrice values.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L503-L510
Now let's see _calculateSell function logic,
It calculates fundsReceived from selling votes using _calcVotePrice function in while loop which iterates untill votesSold = amount of votes user specify to sell.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1031-L1040
now value of fundsReceived = amount from selling votes.
Then it internally calls PreviewFees function which calculates the exitProtocolFee and returns exitProtocolFee and fundsReceived after deducting exitProtocolfee from it.
now, fundsReceived = amount from selling votes - exitProtocolFee.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1041
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1141-L1153
now sellVotes function internally calls applyFees function which sends exitProtocolFee to protocolFeeAddress.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L517
then it calls _sendEth function which transfers fundReceived to user who is  selling the votes.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L520
now as we observe both exitProtocolFee and fundReceived is transferred out of ReputationMarket contract.so we should deduct fundReceived+protocolFee from marketFunds[profileId],but we wrongly deducting only fundReceived from marketFunds[profileId].
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L522
now marketFunds[profileId] value will be greater than what it should be by exitProtocolFee.
so now when user with GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL role withdrawing from GraduatedMarketFunds it will transfer more funds than what actually should transfer to him.
which means exitProtocolFee was collecting twice from the contract which will break accounting of the contract.
so user transactions in future will revert due to out of funds(contract not having enough Eth to give to users who sell there votes and while withdrawing GraduatedMarketFunds).

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

wrongly collecting exitProtocolFee from ReputationMarket twice for every time a user sells votes(1)while selling votes 2)while withdrawing from GraduatedMarketFunds), which will break accounting of the contract(Eth balance of contract is not enough to pay to users who sell their votes and at time of withdrawing GraduatedMarketFunds in future).so users loss there funds.

### Mitigation

modify code here,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L522
with this,
marketFunds[profileId] -= (fundsReceived+protocolFee);
so that marketFunds[profileId] is correctly updated.
