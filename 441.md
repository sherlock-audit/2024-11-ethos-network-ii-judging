# In the `ReputationMarket.buyVotes()` function, the entry fees are incorrectly added to `marketFunds` because `fundsPaid` includes these fees.

### Summary
The state variable `marketFunds` stores the total funds paid to the market for each `profileId`. It should not include the paid fees, as the amount in `marketFunds` must be deducted upon withdrawal. However, the fees are incorrectly added to `marketFunds` when buying votes, leading to a loss of funds.

### Root Cause
The state variable `marketFunds` stores the total funds paid to the market for each `profileId` when buying votes.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481
```solidity
        marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
```

However, `protocolFee` and `donation` are incorrectly added to `fundsPaid`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L978
```solidity
        fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;
```

Because `protocolFee` is already sent to `protocolFeeAddress` and `donation` can be claimed any time.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1116-L1127
```solidity
    function applyFees(
        uint256 protocolFee,
        uint256 donation,
        uint256 marketOwnerProfileId
    ) private returns (uint256 fees) {
@>      donationEscrow[donationRecipient[marketOwnerProfileId]] += donation;
        if (protocolFee > 0) {
        (bool success, ) = protocolFeeAddress.call{ value: protocolFee }("");
        if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Protocol fee deposit failed");
        }
@>      fees = protocolFee + donation;
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L570-L585
```solidity
    function withdrawDonations() public whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
@>      uint256 amount = donationEscrow[msg.sender];
        if (amount == 0) {
        revert InsufficientFunds();
        }

        // Reset escrow balance before transfer to prevent reentrancy
        donationEscrow[msg.sender] = 0;

        // Transfer the funds
@>      (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: amount }("");
        if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Donation withdrawal failed");

        emit DonationWithdrawn(msg.sender, amount);
        return amount;
    }
``` 

When withdrawing funds from a graduated market, the whole amount stored in `marketFunds` is withdrawn.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L660-L678
```solidity
    function withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(uint256 profileId) public whenNotPaused {
            [... ...]
@>      _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]);
        emit MarketFundsWithdrawn(profileId, msg.sender, marketFunds[profileId]);
@>      marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
    }
```

Therefore, an insufficient remaining ether balance in `ReputationMarket` results in a loss of funds for users.
