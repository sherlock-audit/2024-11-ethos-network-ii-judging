### Summary

[EthosVouch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L67) and [ReputationMarket](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L36) contract inherits the [`AccessControl`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/AccessControl.sol#L15) and openzeppelin `UUPSUpgradeable` contract, where the parent `AccessControl` contract has storage slot but no gaps, result in corrupted storage slot when admin updates.
