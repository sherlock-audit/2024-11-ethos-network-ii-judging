# The maximum total fees can be as high as 100%

### Summary

Currently, the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is equal to `10000`, but according to the README, the maximum total fees should not exceed 10%. This creates a potential risk for a rug pull.

### Root Cause

In [EthosVouch:120](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120), the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is equal to `10000`.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. A user calls `EthosVouch::vouchByProfileId()` to vouch for a subject.
2. The fee values are changed so that the exit fee equals 100%.
3. The user calls `EthosVouch::unvouch()` but will not receive any funds.

### Impact

An admin can execute a rug pull and scam the vouchers.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

`MAX_TOTAL_FEES` should be changed to `1000`.
