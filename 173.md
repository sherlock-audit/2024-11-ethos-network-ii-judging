# Users can avoid slashing

### Summary

`EthosVouch` implements slashing, which are a form of punishment when a user misbehaves in any manner. When a user is slashed he looses up to 10% of all his vouches balance.

```solidity
    uint256[] storage vouchIds = vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId];

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchIds.length; i++) {
      Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];

      if (!vouch.archived) {
        uint256 slashAmount = vouch.balance.mulDiv(
          slashBasisPoints,
          BASIS_POINT_SCALE,
          Math.Rounding.Floor
        );
        if (slashAmount > 0) {
          vouch.balance -= slashAmount;
          totalSlashed += slashAmount;
        }
      }
    }
```

Before anyone gets slashed there is a trial period to let the decision makers decide if the user should or should not be slashed. This is explain well in discord, while also stated in the [docs](https://whitepaper.ethos.network/ethos-mechanisms/slash)
>  This accusation triggers a 24h lock on staking (and withdrawals) for the accused. 

However such users can leave the system during that period, as there is no such lock up period. The user can just call `unvouch` and take back his ETH before this time passes, thus essentially avoiding the slashing.

Other methods, although harder would be to front-run the slash and escape just before it.

### Root Cause

User being able to leave whenever he wants when he is under his trial period.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User who has vouched 50 ETH in total misbehaves massively (farming accounts to `unvouch` and  `markUnhealthy` his competition)
2. A trial period starts for that user
3. The user just unvouches and leaves the system unharmed

Another scenario would be
1. User who has vouched 50 ETH in total misbehaves massively
2. Admins call directly to slash said user
3. The user front-runs the call and unvouches leaving the system unharmed

### Impact

Users who are marked for slashing would be able to avoid it, without being punished for their misdeeds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a special method to pause `unvouch` for any user. Example code:

```diff
+  // authorProfileId -> is blacklisted
+  mapping(uint256 => bool) public blacklist;

   // ...
   function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];

    _vouchShouldExist(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);

+   if(blacklist[v.authorProfileId]){
+     revert Blacklisted(authorProfileId);
+  }
```
