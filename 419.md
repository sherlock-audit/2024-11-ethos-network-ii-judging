# If protocolFeeAddress refuses to receive ETH, protocol users will be unable to exit.

### Summary

In ReputationMarket and EthosVouch contracts, many functions rely on protocolFeeAddress to receive ETH normally. For example sellVotes and unvouch. If protocolFeeAddress maliciously refuses to accept ETH, users will be unable to unvouch or sell votes. Similarly, the purchase of votes and guarantee functions are also unavailable.
Since protocolFeeAddress is not a trusted address, this possibility exists.

### Root Cause

In [EthosVouch.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L883-L886) and [ReputationMarket.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1123), almost all major functions rely on protocolFeeAddress to receive ETH properly.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. The protocolFeeAddress refuses to receive ETH.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users will be unable to unvouch or sell votes. The protocol function cannot be used normally

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use a fixed open source protocolFeeAddress to ensure that it can receive ETH normally.
