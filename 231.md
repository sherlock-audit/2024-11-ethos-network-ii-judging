# Unhandled reward distribution when no previous vouchers exist

## Summary
A vulnerability exists in the `_rewardPreviousVouchers` function that prevents reward distribution when no previous vouchers are present. This can lead to potential loss of fees and unexpected behavior in the reward allocation mechanism.

## code snippet:

## Vulnerability Details
In the current implementation, when `totalBalance` is zero (indicating no previous vouchers), the function immediately returns without distributing the rewards. Specifically, the code snippet:
```solidity 
  if (totalBalance == 0) {
     return totalBalance;
  }
```
This means that:
1. Any incoming rewards or fees for a subject profile with no previous vouchers are effectively lost
2. The passed amount parameter is not utilized or tracked

## Impact
1. Financial Loss: Fees can be permanently trapped in the contract
2. Inconsistent Reward Mechanism: Early-stage (when there are no previous vouchers yet) the systems may frequently encounter this scenario
3. Lack of Funds Recoverability: No clear path exists to recover or reallocate undistributed rewards

## Recommendations
   Transfer to a designated treasury or reserve `_depositProtocolFee(amount)`
