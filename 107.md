# Inconsistent MarketFunds Tracking in `ReputationMarket::buyVotes` Leads to Potential Break of the protocol

### Summary

The `marketFunds` tracking becomes inflated because when buying votes, the full amount including fees is added to `marketFunds` even though the fees have been sent out of the contract.
On [buys](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481), the protocol adds the total funds sent by the buyer (including `protocolFee` and `donations` in [`_calculateBuy`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L978)) to `marketFunds[profileId]`.
The problem is that the `procolFee` in the `buyVotes` are sent directly to the `protocolFeeAddress`, This inconsistency causes marketFunds to overestimate the actual balance available for withdrawals. In a multi-market scenario, this discrepancy allows a market withdrawal to deplete funds reserved for other markets, effectively creating a cross-market fund drain vulnerability.

### Root Cause

In ['_calculateBuy'](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L978) we calculate `fundsPaid` and then add `protocolFee ` and `donation` this amount is then added to marketFunds in `BuyVotes`
```javascript
   marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
 ``` 
The problem is that `ProtocolFee` has already been [sent](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L464) to the `protocolFeeAddress` which leads inflated view of available funds for each market.
A simple scenario case would be:
- `BuyVotes` is called with 1 ETH (no refunds).
- `ProtocolFee` is 0.1 ETH (sent to `protocolFeeAddress`) and `donation` is 0.05 ETH
The current balance of the ReputationMarket is (1-0.1=0.9ETH) However `marketFunds[profileId] = 1 ETH'
A simple Withdraw from `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` will revert.
### Internal pre-conditions

`marketFunds[profileId]` is incremented by the total amount sent during `buyVotes`.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path
The attack path is simple, when a market is created, the `marketFunds` are inflated due to the count of fees, this means a simple `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds`  will either revert or deplete funds intended for other markets.

### Impact

1. The protocol's actual Ether balance becomes insufficient to cover marketFunds for all markets.
2. Withdrawals for one market can steal funds reserved for other markets.
This break the invariant of the protocol ` The vouch and vault contracts must never revert a transaction due to running out of funds.`


### PoC

This poc is a simple test to demonstrate that the tracked funds are bigger than the the current balance, if one tries to `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` the example will revert
```javascript
   address user1 = address(10);
function testMarketFundsAccounting() public {
        uint256 profileId = 10;
        uint256 depositAmount = 1 ether;

        // Create market with initial liquidity
        vm.deal(user1, depositAmount);
        vm.startPrank(user1);
        market.createMarket{value: depositAmount}();
        vm.stopPrank();
        console.log("user1 address", user1);
        // User2 buys votes
        vm.deal(user2, depositAmount);
        vm.startPrank(user2);
        market.buyVotes{value: depositAmount}(profileId, true, 0, 500);
        vm.stopPrank();

        // Check the accounting
        uint256 trackedFunds = market.marketFunds(profileId);
        uint256 actualBalance = address(market).balance;

        console.log("Tracked funds:", trackedFunds);
        console.log("Actual balance:", actualBalance);
        console.log("Difference:", trackedFunds - actualBalance);

        // The tracked funds will be higher than actual balance by the amount of fees
        assertTrue(trackedFunds > actualBalance, "Tracked funds should be higher than actual balance");
        // withdraw donation 
        vm.startPrank(user1);
        market.withdrawDonations();
        vm.stopPrank();
        uint256 BalanceAfter = address(market).balance;
        console.log("Actual balance after withdraw donation:", BalanceAfter);
        // after setting the graduateaddr you can uncomment this section to see the revert error
        // vm.startPrank(graduateaddr);
        // market.graduateMarket(profileId);
        // // revert because of Out of funds -vvv for more details
        // vm.expectRevert('ETH transfer failed'); 
        // market.withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(profileId);
        // vm.stopPrank();

    }
```

### Mitigation

Don't include fees in `marketFunds` in the `BuyVotes`. (for `donation` another finding will highlight the issue with the current implementation)
