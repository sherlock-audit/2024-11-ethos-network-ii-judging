# An incorrect fee calculation will lead to users paying fees that are higher than expected.

### Summary
The formula `fee = total - (total * 10000 / (10000 + feeBasisPoints))` are used in the protocol. This derivaton of formula is correct, but it works well only when there is only one fee mechanism. However, three kinds of fee are calculated at once when vouching. As a result, users pay fees more than expected. 

### Root Cause

The formula `fee = total - (total * 10000 / (10000 + feeBasisPoints))` are used in the protocol.

```solidity
  function calcFee(uint256 total, uint256 feeBasisPoints) internal pure returns (uint256 fee) {
    /*
     * Formula derivation:
     * 1. total = deposit + fee
     * 2. fee = deposit * (feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 3. total = deposit + deposit * (feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 4. total = deposit * (1 + feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 5. deposit = total / (1 + feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 6. fee = total - deposit
     * 7. fee = total - (total * 10000 / (10000 + feeBasisPoints))
     */
    return
@>    total -
@>    (total.mulDiv(BASIS_POINT_SCALE, (BASIS_POINT_SCALE + feeBasisPoints), Math.Rounding.Floor));
  }
```

This derivaton of formula is correct, but it works well only when there is only one kind of fee. 
However, three kinds of fee are calculated at once when vouching.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L936-L938
```solidity
@>    uint256 protocolFee = calcFee(amount, entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints);
@>    uint256 donationFee = calcFee(amount, entryDonationFeeBasisPoints);
@>    uint256 vouchersPoolFee = calcFee(amount, entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints);
```

As a result, users pay fees more than expected. 


### Internal pre-conditions
    entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints = 100
    entryDonationFeeBasisPoints = 200
    entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints = 300 

### External pre-conditions
none

### Attack Path
    Alice vouches 1 ether to Bob.
        Then, the total amount of fee is:
            1e18 - (1e18 * 10000 / (10000 + 100)) + 
            1e18 - (1e18 * 10000 / (10000 + 200)) +
            1e18 - (1e18 * 10000 / (10000 + 300)) = 58635046828497813
        The actually vouched amount is:
            1e18 - 39361292638517065 = 941364953171502187

        In fact, the expected total amount of fee is:
            941364953171502187 * 100 / 10000 +
            941364953171502187 * 200 / 10000 +
            941364953171502187 * 300 / 10000 = 56481897190290129

        58635046828497813 - 56481897190290129 = 2153149638207684

    So, alice pays 2153149638207684 wei more than expected, which is about 3.8% of the expected amount of total fee.
    This percentage will increase as the percentage of all fees rises.

### Impact
Users pay fees more than expected. 

### PoC
none

### Mitigation
The formula `fee = total - (total * 10000 / (10000 + feeBasisPoints))` are used with the sum of all fee percentage.
