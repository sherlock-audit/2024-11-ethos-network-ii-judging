# `ReputationMarket::buyVotes()` includes Fees paid in Market Funds

### Summary

Fees are paid to the protocol and Escrow when buying Votes, leading to increasing in Market funds that the real Ether puts in it.


### Root Cause

in `ReputationMarket::buyVotes()` the caller sends Ether, and Fees are taken from the user. `_calculateBuy()` returns the amount of ETH for buying a certain number of votes including protocol fees and escrow [1]. Then, fees are transferred to protocols and Escrow [2]. Then, We deduct this amount from the ether sent `msg.value` and return the user [3]. Lastly. increase Market funds buy `fundsPaid` [4].

[ReputationMarket.sol#L481](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481)
```solidity
  function buyVotes( ... ) public payable whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // Determine how many votes can be bought with the funds provided
    (
      uint256 votesBought,
1:    uint256 fundsPaid,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);

    _checkSlippageLimit(votesBought, expectedVotes, slippageBasisPoints);

    // Apply fees first
2:  applyFees(protocolFee, donation, profileId);

    ...

    // Calculate and refund remaining funds
    uint256 refund = msg.value - fundsPaid;
3:  if (refund > 0) _sendEth(refund);

    // tally market funds
4:  marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
    ...
  }
```

`fundsPaid` includes the money paid for Votes as well as fees. Fees are not stored in the contract, they are transfered to the protocol directly, and escrow can withdraw his token anytime, so this will make the amount stored in Market funds greater than the actual ether stored in the contract.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This will have a more critical problem, where the profile can get `Graduated`, which will allow `GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL` to withdraw the money stored in the market (`marketFunds`). But as the value is greater than the actual ETH sent by Voters for that profile Market (because of not decreasing protocol Fees and escrow donations when buying votes), this will result in decreasing the actual Ether balance from the contract, breaking the invariant of actual ETH stored be >= Internal Balance stored in the contract (Market Funds, Escrow).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Subtract the fees sent to the protocol (entry fees) and donations to escrow from the total money paid by the voter before, then increase the market funds with that amount.
