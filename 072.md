# Critical Index Mismatch in removeMarketConfig: Off-Chain Data Integrity at Risk

### Summary

The removeMarketConfig function swaps the configuration to be removed with the last configuration in the array before removing it. This causes an inconsistency in the index-to-config mapping without emitting an event to indicate the change. Indexers relying on the emitted events may retain outdated references, leading to incorrect data in off-chain systems.

To address this issue, emit a new event, MarketConfigUpdated, whenever a configuration is swapped to update indexers with the new mapping.

### Root Cause

- In [ReputationMarket.sol:400](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L400) is emitted that config was removed with configIndex
- In [ReputationMarket.sol:403-406](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L403-L406) configs are swapped, so id were changed


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

- Multiple market configurations exist in the marketConfigs array.
- At least one configuration index is tracked off-chain by an indexer based on emitted events (MarketConfigAdded).

### Attack Path

- A user or admin removes a configuration at an index other than the last one.
- The function swaps the configuration with the last one and emits a MarketConfigRemoved event for the removed index.
- No event is emitted for the new mapping of the swapped configuration.
- Indexers retain outdated mappings, causing inconsistencies in off-chain systems and potentially leading to errors in user interfaces or reporting systems.

### Impact

While this bug does not compromise on-chain functionality or security, it affects the reliability of off-chain systems, which can lead to incorrect data being displayed to users or invalid operations in dependent systems.

### PoC

### Mitigation

    Introduce a new event, MarketConfigUpdated, and emit it whenever a configuration index is changed due to the swap.

```solidity
event MarketConfigUpdated(uint256 oldIndex, uint256 newIndex, MarketConfig updatedConfig);
```

Update the removeMarketConfig function to emit the new event:

```solidity
if (configIndex != lastIndex) {
    marketConfigs[configIndex] = marketConfigs[lastIndex];
    emit MarketConfigUpdated(lastIndex, configIndex, marketConfigs[configIndex]);
}
```

This ensures indexers can track updates to the index mapping and maintain accurate off-chain data.
