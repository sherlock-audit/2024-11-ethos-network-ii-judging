# Maximum total fees can exceed 10%

### Summary

The constant `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is hardcoded to 10000, which makes maximum total fees can exceed 10%.

### Root Cause

In the contest [readme](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/675?filter=questions), it says ' Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10% ', but in [EthosVouch.sol:120](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120C3-L120C50), the constant `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is hardcoded to 10000, which means the maximum total fees can be set to 100%.
