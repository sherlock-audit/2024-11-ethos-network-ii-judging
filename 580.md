# Incorrect MAX_TOTAL_FEES value breaks core invariant of the protocol

### Summary

Incorrect MAX_TOTAL_FEES value breaks core invariant of the protocol

### Root Cause

According to docs: "For both contracts: Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%."

However, in EthosVouch.sol that invariant is no respected and the maximum total fees can be up to 100%, clearly breaking a main invariant of the protocol, as the limit is set to 10000 BPS.

uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;

Even if Admin is a trusted address, this is still an issue because Admin expects that the fee modification will revert if total fee values exceeds 10%, making him not worry if the modification succeeds. However Admin could unconsciously set a value for fees which exceeds 10% maximum and he will not be aware of that, as the change succeeded.

### Attack Path

Current fee values for protocolFeeBasisPoints, donationFeeBasisPoints, entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints and exitFeeBasisPoints are 200, 250, 250 and 250 respectively. Because of Ethos protocol is really demanded the protocolFeeBasisPoints is updated to 400 BP, checkFeeExceedsMaximum() function is called and as the new fee total value does not exceed 10000, the change is correctly applied.

However, fee total value has exceeded the 1000 BPS limit established as invariant for the protocol, breaking with the invariant as Admin is not aware of this.

### Impact

Fee total value will exceed the limit imposed by Ethos protocol rules, breaking a core invariant of the protocol and making protocol charge an aggregated higher amount of fees than it should when creating, increasing value or unvouching a Vouch.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change the limit for maximum fee total value:

```solidity
- uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
+ uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000;
```
