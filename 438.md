# `ReputationMarket::sellVotes` function accounts `marketFunds` incorrectly

### Summary

`ReputationMarket::sellVotes` function accounts `marketFunds` incorrectly and this could affect the withdrawal of graduated markets and the withdrawal of donation.

### Root Cause

`ReputationMarket::sellVotes` function handles `fundsReceived` and `protocolFee` incorrectly.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Some of the graduated markets and donation recipients will be unable to withdraw their funds due to the lack of balance of the contract.

### PoC

When users sell their votes, `_calculateSell` function is invoked and returns `fundsReceived` and `protocolFee`.

```solidity

File: ReputationMarket.sol
1003: function _calculateSell(
1004:     Market memory market,
1005:     uint256 profileId,
1006:     bool isPositive,
1007:     uint256 amount
1008:   )
1009:     private
1010:     view
1011:     returns (
1012:       uint256 votesSold,
1013:       uint256 fundsReceived,
1014:       uint256 newVotePrice,
1015:       uint256 protocolFee,
1016:       uint256 minVotePrice,
1017:       uint256 maxVotePrice
1018:     )
1019:   {

1031:     while (votesSold < amount) {
1032:       if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
1033:         revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
1034:       }
1035: 
1036:       market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
1037:       votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
1038:       fundsReceived += votePrice;
1039:       votesSold++;
1040:     }
1041:     (fundsReceived, protocolFee, ) = previewFees(fundsReceived, false);
1042:     minPrice = votePrice;
1043: 
1044:     return (votesSold, fundsReceived, votePrice, protocolFee, minPrice, maxPrice);
1045:   }

```

`fundsReceived` is ajusted by `previewFees` function at [L1041](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1041).

```solidity
File: ReputationMarket.sol
1141: function previewFees(
1142:     uint256 amount,
1143:     bool isEntry
1144:   ) private view returns (uint256 funds, uint256 protocolFee, uint256 donation) {
1145:     if (isEntry) {
1146:       protocolFee = (amount * entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;
1147:       donation = (amount * donationBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;
1148:     } else {
1149:       protocolFee = (amount * exitProtocolFeeBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;
1150:     }
1151:     funds = amount - protocolFee - donation;
1152:   }

```
As evident from the above code snippet, the `fundsReceived` is deducted by the `protocolFee` and `donation`.

`sellVotes` function sends `protocolFee` by calling `applyFees` function at [L517](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L517). And the `marketFunds` is reduced by the `fundsReceived` at [L522](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L522).

Hence, `protocolFee` which should sent from `marketFunds` are not accounted anywhere and just reduces the contract balance. The `marketFunds` is never affected by the `protocolFee`. So it is obivious that the `Ether` balance of the contract could be smaller than the sum of all the `marketFunds` and donation escrow.

As a result, the some of the graduate markets and the donation recipients could be unable to withdraw their funds due to the lack of funds.

### Mitigation

It is recommended to fix the `sellVotes` function as follows:

```diff

function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // calculate the amount of votes to sell and the funds received
    (
      uint256 votesSold,
      uint256 fundsReceived,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);

    // update the market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;

    // apply protocol fees
    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

    // send the proceeds to the seller
    _sendEth(fundsReceived);
    // tally market funds
-   marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived; 
+   marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived + protocolFee; 
    emit VotesSold(
      profileId,
      msg.sender,
      isPositive,
      votesSold,
      fundsReceived,
      block.timestamp,
      minVotePrice,
      maxVotePrice
    );
    _emitMarketUpdate(profileId);
  }
```
