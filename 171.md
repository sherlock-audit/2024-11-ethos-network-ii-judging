# `AccessControl` lacks any storage gaps, meaning that if any of the contracts are upgraded it can cause storage collision

### Summary

`AccessControl` used inside both [EthosVouch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L67) and [ReputationMarket](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L36) in order to reduce the complexity inside these contracts, by handling all the owner/admin functions (pause, unpause, upgrade, so on...).

This contract has 1 storage slot allocated to it:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/AccessControl.sol#L34
```solidity
  constructor() {
    _disableInitializers();
  }

  bytes32 public constant OWNER_ROLE = keccak256("OWNER_ROLE");
  bytes32 public constant ADMIN_ROLE = keccak256("ADMIN_ROLE");

  IContractAddressManager public contractAddressManager;
```

The issue we face here is that `AccessControl` has active storage and is part of the whole system, which is upgradable. Meaning that if any storage variables are added to `AccessControl` it will cause a storage collision across both `EthosVouch` and `ReputationMarket`.

### Root Cause

`AccessControl` being upgradable and having storage while it has not implemented any gap measure.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Upgrade is planned
2. 1 storage variable is added to `AccessControl` to track something related to owner/admins
3. upgrade is executed causing storage collision in both `EthosVouch` and `ReputationMarket` possibly resulting in both contract being bricked

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The whole system being bricked due to a storage collision.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding a `uint256 gap[50]` in order to allow any future upgrades without causing storage collisions.
