# Not restricting the vouching for `mockId` could result in funds being locked in the contract

## Root cause
The EthosVouch contract does not restrict users from vouching for a `mockProfile`, based on the assumption that the `mockProfile` will later be created and used. However, this assumption is not always valid. Letâ€™s analyze a few scenarios where a `mockId` might be created:

1. **Publishing Reviews for an EVM Address Not Associated with a Profile:**  
   In this case, the subject can be any valid EVM address, such as Uniswap or other ecosystem protocol contracts. Since these addresses do not implement the functionality to call `createProfile` and associate the `mockId` with a verified profile, this `mockId` will never become a valid profile.

2. **Publishing Reviews for an Attestation Not Associated with a Profile:**  
   In this scenario, a new `profileId` will be occupied, effectively creating a `mockId`. If the attestation is later claimed by a verified profile, the previously created `mockProfile` becomes obsolete. Furthermore, this `mockProfile` will never have an address associated with it, rendering it permanently inactive.

If a user vouches for either of the two types of `mockProfiles` described above, part of the user's funds will be used to pay the [entryDonationFee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L944-L946). This fee needs to be claimed by the address associated with the `mockProfile`. However, since the aforementioned types of `mockProfiles` will never have an associated address, this portion of the funds will remain unclaimable and locked in the contract indefinitely.

## Impact
Some fee-related funds may become locked in the contract, with no one able to claim them.
## Internal pre-condition
- None
## External pre-condition
- None

## PoC
1. User 1 posts a review on an unassociated Attestation, which will occupy profileId=2, effectively creating a mockProfile.
2. Some users vouch for this `mockProfile`.  
3. The `entryDonationFee` paid by these users cannot be claimed by anyone, and will be locked in the contract.

## Mitigation

The protocol should consider a mechanism for handling these funds to prevent the fees from being permanently locked in the contract.
