# Missing slippage protection in `ReputationMarket::sellVotes()`

### Summary

Before users sell their votes, they have the option to call `ReputationMarket::simulateSell()`. This function simulates selling votes to preview the transaction outcome. If the user likes that outcome, they can call `ReputationMarket::sellVotes()`.

However, there is no slippage protection in [ReputationMarket::sellVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L534), meaning the outcome could change. This can occur if another user sells the same type of votes for the same market or buys the opposite type of votes for the same market between the call to simulate a sell and the actual sell call. As a result, users might earn a lot less for their votes than the amount calculated by`ReputationMarket::simulateSell()`.

This does not need to happen due to frontrunning, it can also occur accidentally.

### Root Cause

In `ReputationMarket.sol::sellVotes()` there is no slippage protection.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The user needs to own votes that they can sell.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Alice calls `ReputationMarket::simulateSell()` to simulate selling an amount of her votes to preview the transaction outcome.
2. Bob decides to sell the same type of vote for the same market and calls `ReputationMarket::sellVotes()`. This causes the vote price for that type and market to decrease.
3. Alice liked the outcome and calls `ReputationMarket::sellVotes()` to sell the same amount of votes she previewed the transaction for, but the outcome is totally different.

### Impact

Users will lose funds depending on the amount of votes they want to sell, the amount of votes other users sold or bought between the two transactions, and the vote base price for the market.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding a slippage protection in `ReputationMarket::sellVotes()`.
