# authorProfileId can avoid being slashed

### Summary

there is not lock lock on lock on staking (and withdrawals) for the accused authorProfileId 

### Root Cause

According to [docs](https://whitepaper.ethos.network/ethos-mechanisms/slash) their should be lock
> Any Ethos participant may act as a "whistleblower" to accuse another participant of inaccurate claims or unethical behavior. This accusation triggers a 24h lock on staking (and withdrawals) for the accused. 
Currently anyone can unvouch at any time
```solidity
  function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
    _vouchShouldExist(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);
    // because it's $$$, you can only withdraw/unvouch to the same address you used to vouch
    // however, we don't care about the status of the address's profile; funds are always attached
    // to an address, not a profile
    if (vouches[vouchId].authorAddress != msg.sender) {
      revert AddressNotVouchAuthor(vouchId, msg.sender, vouches[vouchId].authorAddress);
    }

    v.archived = true;
    // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
    v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt = block.timestamp;
    // remove the vouch from the tracking arrays and index mappings
    _removeVouchFromArrays(v);

    // apply fees and determine how much is left to send back to the author
    (uint256 toWithdraw, ) = applyFees(v.balance, false, v.subjectProfileId);
    // set the balance to 0 and save back to storage
    v.balance = 0;
    // send the funds to the author
    // note: it sends it to the same address that vouched; not the one that called unvouch
    (bool success, ) = payable(v.authorAddress).call{ value: toWithdraw }("");
    if (!success) {
      revert FeeTransferFailed("Failed to send ETH to author");
    }

    emit Unvouched(v.vouchId, v.authorProfileId, v.subjectProfileId);
  }

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Accused profile sees that a lot of complains going against him and unvouch all vouched funds before slashing

### Impact

authorProfileId can avoid being slashed

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff

+    function pauseActions(uint authorProfileId) external onlyOwner{
+        ...
+    }

  function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant  {
+      uint256 authorProfileId = IEthosProfile(
+          contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
+      ).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);
+    require(!isActionsPaused(authorProfileId), "actions paused")
      Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
    _vouchShouldExist(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);
