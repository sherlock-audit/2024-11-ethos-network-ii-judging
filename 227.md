# `_calcVotePrice` rounds in favor of the user when he buys

### Summary

`_calcVotePrice` is used to calculate the votes when users buy or sell vote

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L920-L923
```solidity
  function _calcVotePrice(Market memory market, bool isPositive) private pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalVotes = market.votes[TRUST] + market.votes[DISTRUST];

    // votes[TRUST / DISTRUST] * basePrice / totalVotes
    return (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] * market.basePrice) / totalVotes;
  }
```

`_calcVotePrice` always rounds down, meaning that when users buy votes, they buy them at a cheaper price. Rounding down will also round sell, however depending on the market, it's base price and liquidity, some buys may round more than the sells, resulting in insolvency for that market.

Such a market can reach insolvency, however the `initialLiquidity` will most likely be enought to cover any minor losses (in wei). However without initial liquidity, markets that reach insolvency will take their ETH from other markets (as all are in the same contract).

Still even if not fully insolvent we violate the bellow statement from the README:
 > Reputation Markets must never sell the initial votes. They must never pay out the initial liquidity deposited. The only way to access those funds is to graduate the market.

### Root Cause

`_calcVotePrice` always rounding in one direction.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Market potentially becoming insolvent.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider making 2 of these, one for buys that will round up (make the buy more expensive by 1 wei) and one for sells (the current one). This way rounding like these will not pose any system threat. Also you can use `mulDiv` (it's already used in one place - `_checkSlippageLimit`)
