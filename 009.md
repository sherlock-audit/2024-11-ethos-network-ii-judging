# Validation of time window allowed to call `markUnhealthy()` forgets to account for any paused duration

## Description & Impact
After calling `unvouch()`, author can call [markUnhealthy()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L496) within a time window of `unhealthyResponsePeriod` or 24 hours which is verified via an [internal call](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L503) to function [_vouchShouldBePossibleUnhealthy()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L857-L858). Consider this:
- User calls `unvouch()` at 10 AM on Day1. They have the liberty to call `markUnhealthy()` until 10 AM on Day2.
- Due to some circumstances protocol is paused at 10:05 AM and it takes 24 hours to resolve the issue and set it back to unpaused state.
- **Impact:** User lost the ability to call `markUnhealthy()` now as the paused time-period was not taken into account by the code logic when calculating `stillHasTime` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L857-L858):
```js
  File: ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol

   855:            function _vouchShouldBePossibleUnhealthy(uint256 vouchId) private view {
   856:              Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
   857:@--->         bool stillHasTime = block.timestamp <=
   858:@--->           v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt + unhealthyResponsePeriod;
   859:          
   860:              if (!v.archived || v.unhealthy || !stillHasTime) {
   861:                revert CannotMarkVouchAsUnhealthy(vouchId);
   862:              }
   863:            }
```

## Mitigation 
The protocol would have to store the timestamps of the start & end of pause states. This is to ensure that even if there are **_multiple_** pauses & unpauses the correct cumulative paused time can be added as a grace period while calculating `stillHasTime`.
