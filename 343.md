# Incorrect `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` Allows Total Fees to Exceed Protocol Limit

## Summary

The `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` constant in the `EthosVouch` contract is incorrectly set to 10000 basis points (100%), contradicting the protocol's documented limit of 10% (1000 basis points) for total fees. 

## Vulnerability Details

The `EthosVouch` contract defines a constant `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` as 10000 basis points (100%):
[EthosVouch.sol#L120](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120)
```js
  uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000; 
```
`checkFeeExceedsMaximum` function is called before updating any fee to ensure the total doesn't exceed `MAX_TOTAL_FEES`
[EthosVouch.sol#L996-L1004](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L996-L1004)
```js
function checkFeeExceedsMaximum(uint256 currentFee, uint256 newFee) internal view { 
    uint256 totalFees = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints +
      exitFeeBasisPoints +
      entryDonationFeeBasisPoints +
      entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints +
      newFee -
      currentFee;
@>   if (totalFees > MAX_TOTAL_FEES) revert FeesExceedMaximum(totalFees, MAX_TOTAL_FEES);
  }
```
While this mechanism enforces a cap, the cap is erroneously set to 100%, which contradicts the protocol requirement documented in the project's __README__:
  
> For both contracts:
  Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%

## Impact
The current implementation allows the maximum total fees to reach 100% instead of the intended 10%

## Recommendation
Update the MAX_TOTAL_FEES constant to enforce the correct protocol limit of 10% (1000 basis points):
```js
uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000; 
```
