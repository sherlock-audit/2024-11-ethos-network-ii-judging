# Vouch rewards are susceptible to MEV attacks

### Summary
When a vouching for someone, the user who vouches has to pay a fee to all previous vouchers. This is only not the case for the first voucher, as there are no previous vouchers to distribute the funds to.

```solidity
  function _rewardPreviousVouchers(
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 subjectProfileId
  ) internal returns (uint256 amountDistributed) {
    uint256[] storage vouchIds = vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId];
    uint256 totalVouches = vouchIds.length;

    // Calculate total balance of all active vouches
    uint256 totalBalance;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalVouches; i++) {
      Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];
      // Only include active (not archived) vouches in the distribution
      if (!vouch.archived) {
        totalBalance += vouch.balance;
      }
    }

    // If this is the first voucher, do not distribute rewards
    if (totalBalance == 0) {
      return totalBalance;
    }
```

This leads to 2 conclusions:
- First voucher never has to pay a fee.
- First voucher will receive a fee from the 2nd voucher only based on the 2nd voucher's amount.

This is highly susceptible to MEV attacks described in _Attack Path_ 

### Root Cause

Wrong logic implemented 

### Attack Path
1. Currently, profile X has 0 vouchers
2. Voucher is about to vouch for 1 ETH.
3. Attacker front-runs the voucher and does a min vouch for 0.001eth.
4. Voucher's tx comes through and pays 1% fee (0.01 ETH) to the attacker 
5. Attacker can withdraw for a profit. 


And if we disregard front-running as a strategy, it would be highly profitable for any MEV bot to just do a min vouch instantly on just verified profiles linked to known addresses of public figures.

### Impact
Loss of funds
