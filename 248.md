# `buyVotes()` in `ReputationMarket.sol` is vulnerable to DOS

### Summary

`buyVotes()` in `ReputationMarket.sol` can be frontrun in such a way that function calls can be strategically denied at the expense of a dedicated attacker.

### Root Cause

`buyVotes()` provides enough information to the mempool for an actor to determine whether or not the call affects them positively or negatively. Transactions can be monitored for the address of the sender, volume, whether or not the votes are TRUST or DISTRUST, and the minimum acceptable slippage in basis points.

`_checkSlippageLimit()` reverts if the price of votes is beyond the acceptable range specified by the caller of `buyVotes()`.  Based on the value of `slippageBasisPoints` passed to `buyVotes()`, an attacker can determine the most efficient action they can take to push the price just beyond the acceptable limit and cause the function call to revert. Provided they have the liquidity and are willing to pay protocol fees, they can frontrun an authentic `buyVotes()` call with their own and cause it to revert, selling their votes back to the protocol afterward.



### Internal pre-conditions

Protocol fees dictate the feasibility of this course of action. The closer they are to zero, the lower the downside in performing this attack.

### External pre-conditions

Affiliates of a reputation market determine that the upside of a positive reputation on Ethos outweighs the downside of whatever protocol fees they must pay to artificially maintain it in this manner.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker takes note of protocol use they deem unsavory.
2. They monitor the mempool for transactions that fit this profile (specific addresses, TRUST/DISTRUST votes.)
3. Once a fitting `buyVotes()` is observed, the attacker submits a call with less gas that results in the price of votes exceeding the threshold of the authentic call, immediately selling their own votes back to the protocol once the authentic call executes to avoid losses and reset the price.
4. This is repeated until the authentic party yields or is forced to purchase their votes at an unfavorable price.

### Impact

Users of the protocol can be denied service at the discretion of an unknown third party. The attacker pays all protocol fees. The affected party is unable to buy votes until either the attacker yields or they accept an unfavorable price.
