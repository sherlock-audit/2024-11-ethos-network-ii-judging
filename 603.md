# Maximum fees to be set is not checked in the initialize function allowing MAX_TOTAL_FEES to be ignored

### Summary

The missing check for setting fees and the invariant of the fees hitting a hardcoded limit of MAX_TOTAL_FEES can be easily bypassed from the `initialize` function.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L282-L285

We can see that the initial fee amount can be set to an amount that completely ignores the hardcoded limits of the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` constant. This will break the protocol and make a re-deployment necessary because if the values are set in such a way that just the sum of three fees at a time surpasses the limit. The fee can never be set to another value.

This happens because the new fees can be set to zero and it'll still revert because the existing fees are already over the limit even without the new fee variable's value.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol breaks and needs re-deployment because of a potential mistake in setting the initial fee values.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check if the addition of the fee variables surpass the expected limit in the `initialize` function as well.
