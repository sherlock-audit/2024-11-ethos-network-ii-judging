# Wrong Price Being Reported

### Summary

`ReputationMarket::_calculateSell` reports wrong `fundsReceived` due to incorrect vote price being inserted.


### Root Cause

`ReputationMarket::_calculateSell` is used in `simulateSell`, and `sellVotes`. This function is being used to calculate the amount of funds received to be transferred to the seller. However there is a vulnerabilities where `fundsReceived` using the new vote price which is calculated after the votes has been decremented rather than past vote price which uses the actual state before the votes decremented. This will result an inaccurate price.

Using the new vote price rather than past price will result a big loss for the seller because he will receive less amount due to incorrect price.
