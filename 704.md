# slippage while selling is insufficient for protecting users

### Summary

when users call sell it calls calculatesell the calculatesell uses min vote price to protect users from slippage however its insufficient in protecting users from receiving less than the the amount they want because it uses the current price as the min price which can deviate every moment since it uses vote price as the min amount even tho front running and griefing a user is very unlikely on l2 but slippage should still be accounted for selling votes because the design of this contract is such that even a single vote affects the price of the vote in a busy market this will cause alot of chaos for users since anytime there is a transaction processed the price of votes will be hugely impacted

### Impact

Users will never be able to execute a transaction at the price they desire. in a busy market this is problematic every vote impacts the price of the vote loss of funds for users



### PoC

Base Price = 0.01 ETH
Trust Votes = 1500
Total Votes = 2500 (Trust + Distrust)
Calculation: (1500 * 0.01) / 2500 = 0.006 ETH

So the price for a single trust vote is 0.006 ETH.

1. alice has 200 she wants to sell her 200 votes at 0.006 eth she calls sell tokens

2.bob who has 300 trust votes sells his votes at 0.006 bob also calls sell tokens

if bobs transaction is processed funds the new market and price will look something like this

totalvotes = 2200
vote price=0.00545

3. alices transaction gets processed after bob but now  the price of token is 0.00545 her transaction is processed at 0.00545   instead of the price at which she wanted to sell 0.006 eth the difference is huge and it is very likely to happen since the price of votes are moving with every little transaction not accounting for slippage and relying solely on the price of the vote can result in a really bad user experience anytime there is a transaction being processed  the slippage will be massive

### Mitigation

add a slippage protection for users
