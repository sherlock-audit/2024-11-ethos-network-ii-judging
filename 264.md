# Missing update to isParticipant

### Summary

isParticipant according to this comment
```// append only; don't bother removing. Use isParticipant to check if they've sold all their votes.```
Should be used to check if a user has sold all their votes, however, this variable is not updated in the [sellVotes function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L534) 

### Root Cause

A user should be removed as a marketParticipant if their new balance after selling votes is 0, however, due to the lack of a check in the `sellVotes` function, a user with 0 votes can still be recorded as a market participant.
