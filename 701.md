# Fix Insufficient Votes Check for Tiered Voting in _calculateSell

### Summary

since there are different marketConfigs in ```_calculateSell``` you can sell until it reaches initial vote of 1

### Root Cause

In ```_calculateSell``` there is sell vote until it reaches ```initialVotes``` 1  but what happens if its not  Default Tier
If its for example Premium Tier you have 10000 ```initialVotes``` this means its incorect logic. You should first get the marketConfig and do a check based on marketConfig.initialVotes

### Attack Path

### Impact

if bigger tier than default tier causes to sell more votes than you actually can since if it was  premium tier you wouldnt be able to sell under the initialVotes of the premium tier which is  10000

### PoC

### Mitigation

get the current ```marketConfigs``` for the profileID and then just replace 1 with marketConfigs.initialVotes
