# The sellVotes function lacks slippage protection, allowing for sandwich attacks that can lead to user losses

### Summary

The absence of slippage protection in the `sellVotes` function will cause a potential loss for users as the function can be exploited through sandwich attacks by malicious actors.

### Root Cause

In `ReputationMarket.sol`, the [sellVotes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L534) function does not implement slippage protection, unlike the [buyVotes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442-L493) function, which allows attackers to manipulate the transaction by front-running / back-running it.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The attacker monitors the `sellVotes` transaction and determines the amount of votes to be sold.
2. The attacker submits a front-running transaction (buyVotes) of the opposite side.
3. After the original transaction is processed, the attacker submits a back-running transaction (sellVotes) to extract value by selling votes after the original seller increased the price of the opposite side.


### Impact

The user suffers a loss due to price manipulation caused by a sandwich attack. The attacker gains the manipulated value from the user's transaction.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, implement slippage protection in the `sellVotes` function similar to the protection in `buyVotes`, ensuring that the funds received for the sale match the expected values within an acceptable slippage limit.
