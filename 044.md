# [M-1] Reordering of `marketConfigs` array leads to incorrect market configurations

### Summary

In the `ReputationMarket::removeMarketConfig` [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L389) when a market configuration is removed, the contract swaps the configuration at the specified index with the last element in the `marketConfigs` array and then removes the last element. This operation reorders the array whenever a configuration other than the last one is removed. As a result, the indices of the remaining configurations change. Since `createMarket(), createMarketWithConfig() and createMarketWithConfigAdmin()` functions rely on indices to select market configurations, users calling these functions may inadvertently create markets with unintended settings, leading to unexpected behavior and potential financial loss. Furthermore, as more `MarketConfigs` are created and removed, the indexes of the configs in the array will keep shuffling around.

### Root Cause

The root cause is reordering of the `marketConfigs` array during the removal process. By swapping and popping elements, the contract changes the indices of configurations without updating any references. This practice causes a mismatch between the expected configuration index and the actual configuration parameters when users attempt to create new markets.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Assume the following scenario
1. We have 5 Tiers. Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum and Diamond. Each with `initialLiquidity` 5X bigger than the previous one, starting from 1 ETH  `initialLiquidity` for Bronze, all the way to 625 ETH for Diamond.
2. Our array has indexes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
3. The admin wants to delete the "Silver" configuration, index 1. It calls the `removeMarketConfig` function.
4. After this function call our array looks like this `Bronze, Diamond, Gold Platinum` or [0, 4, 2, 3]
5. A user calls the `createMarketWithConfig(1)` thinking that they will create a new market with the `Silver` config and `initialLiquidity` of 5 ETH. Instead, what will happen is they will create a `Diamond` tier market and provide 625 ETH `initialLiquidity` instead of 5.

### Impact

1. Users may end up transferring more funds than intended as `initialLiquidity` into the market that they just created because different tiers have different `initialLiquidity` requirements and setup parameters.
2. If the user wants to withdraw the excess amount that they sent due to this error, they will incur the exit fee leading to loss of funds for users. In my example above, realizing what just happened, the user attempting to withdraw the 620 excess ETH sent to the contract stands to lose up to 5% of the deposited amount as fees.
3. As more and more markets get created and removed, the indexes of the array's elements will shuffle. Eventually, the Admin may unknowingly end up deleting a `MarketConfig` that they didn't intend to delete. In my example above, if the developer attempts to remove the tier at index 1 again, instead of removing the "Gold" tier, they will remove the "Diamond" tier.
4. The reliability of the contract's behavior is compromised, as the outcome of actions depends on the mutable state of the array indices.

### PoC

Add the following test inside the `rep.price.test.ts` file

```javascript
  describe("Market Configurations Reordering", () => {
    it("should demonstrate that removing market config reorders configs leading to incorrect market creation", async () => {
      // Step 1: Read the current available marketConfigs
      let marketConfigCount = await reputationMarket.getMarketConfigCount();
      console.log("Market config count is: ", marketConfigCount);

      // Fetch initial market configurations
      const initialMarketConfigs = [];
      for (let i = 0; i < marketConfigCount; i++) {
        const config = await reputationMarket.marketConfigs(i);
        initialMarketConfigs.push(config);
        console.log("Initial config is: ", config);
      }

      // Step 2: Remove market config at index 0
      await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).removeMarketConfig(0);

      // Fetch updated market configurations
      const updatedMarketConfigs = [];
      const updatedMarketConfigCount = await reputationMarket.getMarketConfigCount();
      for (let i = 0; i < updatedMarketConfigCount; i++) {
        const config = await reputationMarket.marketConfigs(i);
        updatedMarketConfigs.push(config);
        console.log("Updated config is: ", config);
      }

      // Step 3: Prove the mismatch
      // The configuration at index 0 should now be the one that was at the last index before removal

      // Original configurations
      const originalConfigAtIndex0 = initialMarketConfigs[0];
      const originalConfigAtLastIndex = initialMarketConfigs[initialMarketConfigs.length - 1];

      // Updated configuration at index 0
      const updatedConfigAtIndex0 = updatedMarketConfigs[0];

      // Verify that the updated config at index 0 matches the original last config (Premium tier)
      expect(updatedConfigAtIndex0.initialLiquidity).to.equal(originalConfigAtLastIndex.initialLiquidity);
      expect(updatedConfigAtIndex0.initialVotes).to.equal(originalConfigAtLastIndex.initialVotes);
      expect(updatedConfigAtIndex0.basePrice).to.equal(originalConfigAtLastIndex.basePrice);

      // Now, when a user calls createMarketWithConfig(0), they will get the Premium tier instead of Default
      // Allow userA to create a market (if not already allowed)
      await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setUserAllowedToCreateMarket(DEFAULT.profileId, true);

      // User A creates a market with config index 0
      await reputationMarket.connect(userA.signer).createMarketWithConfig(0, {
        value: updatedConfigAtIndex0.initialLiquidity,
      });

      // Get the market for userA
      const market = await reputationMarket.getMarket(DEFAULT.profileId);

      // Check that the market was created with the wrong config (Premium tier instead of Default)
      expect(market.trustVotes).to.equal(updatedConfigAtIndex0.initialVotes);
      expect(market.distrustVotes).to.equal(updatedConfigAtIndex0.initialVotes);

      // The expected initialVotes should NOT match the Default tier's initialVotes (which is 1)
      expect(market.trustVotes).to.not.equal(originalConfigAtIndex0.initialVotes);

      // Output the mismatch for clarity
      console.log(
        `Mismatch: Users calling market config at index 0 expect initialVotes ${originalConfigAtIndex0.initialVotes.toString()}, but get ${market.trustVotes.toString()}`,
      );
    });
  });
```

Test output
```javascript

Updated config is:  Result(3) [ 500000000000000000n, 1000n, 10000000000000000n ]
Mismatch: Users calling market config at index 0 expect initialVotes 1, but get 10000
      âœ” should demonstrate that removing market config reorders configs leading to incorrect market creation
```

### Mitigation

Avoid reordering the elements of the `marketConfigs` array. Implement changes that will maintain the array's order irrespective of the index that gets deleted.
