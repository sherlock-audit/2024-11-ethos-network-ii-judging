# The initialization function does not check the fund fee rates

## Root cause
The contract strictly limits the total fund fee rate to not exceed 10%. The `EthosVouch` contract performs a `checkFeeExceedsMaximum` check when setting fees. However, this check is missing in the `initialize` function. Worse, if the sum of any three fee rates exceeds `MAX_TOTAL_FEES`, the administrator is [unable to restore the fee rates to normal](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L996-L1003) parameters.
## Impact
The contract's total fees may be set to exceed 10% and can never be restored to a valid configuration.
## Internal pre-condition
## External pre-condition
In the `initialize` function, the total fund fee rate is set to exceed `MAX_TOTAL_FEES`,, and the sum of any three fee rates exceeds `MAX_TOTAL_FEES`,. This configuration can result in the total fee rate being invalid and unrecoverable.

## PoC
When the administrator attempts to modify one of the fees to a valid value, the transaction will revert because the sum of the remaining three fees exceeds the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES`, which causes the total fee rate to exceed the allowed limit.
```solidity
  function checkFeeExceedsMaximum(uint256 currentFee, uint256 newFee) internal view {
    uint256 totalFees = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints +
      exitFeeBasisPoints +
      entryDonationFeeBasisPoints +
      entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints +
      newFee -
      currentFee;
@>  if (totalFees > MAX_TOTAL_FEES) revert FeesExceedMaximum(totalFees, MAX_TOTAL_FEES);
  }
```
## Mitigation
Perform a maximum value check on the fee rates passed to the `initialize` function of both contracts.
