# Lack of slippage protection fot ETH spend/received in ReputationMarket.sol

### Summary

In `buyVotes()` and `sellVotes()` functions there is no slippage protection fot ETH spend/received. User can only specify number of votes he expects to receive, but not the price of this votes.

### Root Cause

[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L534)

User can set the expected number of votes when buying them, but cannot set the expected amount to pay for them when buying votes, or the expected amount he will receive for selling them.
```solidity
  function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);


    // calculate the amount of votes to sell and the funds received
    (
      uint256 votesSold,
      uint256 fundsReceived,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);


    // update the market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;


    // apply protocol fees
    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);


    // send the proceeds to the seller
    _sendEth(fundsReceived);
    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
//...
    _emitMarketUpdate(profileId);
  }
```
In some markets, the price can be very volatile, leading to unexpected overpayments or selling votes at a discounted price.

> * Market configurations offer different initial setups to control the volatility and stability of reputation markets.
> * With the default configuration, a low number of initial votes can cause significant price fluctuations, leading to a highly volatile market.
> * lower initial votes result in faster price changes


### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

The vote price changed after the user's call because some sell/buy transactions were executed earlier that user's one.

### Attack Path

Example:
`TRUST/DISTRUST` votes in market - 10/10, total votes - 20;
base price - 100 ETH:

- Amelie wants to sell 3 votes (TRUST) and expects to receive 141.8 ETH;
```solidity
fundsReceived = (10 * 100e18/20) + (9 * 100e18/19) + (8 * 100e18/18) = 141.8 ETH
```
- Due to private mempool on Base L2, Amelie has no control over order of transactions execution;
- If Bob's transaction to sell 2 votes (TRUST) was executed right before her transaction, Amelie would receive 123 ETH:
```solidity
fundsReceived (Bob) = (10 * 100e18/20) + (9 * 100e18/19) = 97.4 ETH
```
```solidity
fundsReceived (Amelie) = (8 * 100e18/18) + (7 * 100e18/17) + (6 * 100e18/16) = 123 ETH
```

### Impact

User suffers unexpected losses due to lack of slippage protection over volatile vote price.

### PoC

See *Attack Path*.

### Mitigation

Allow users to set slippage limits over ETH spend/received in `buyVotes()` and `sellVotes()`.
