# Vouch author will forced to close some vouch in case of decreasing vouchLimit

### Summary

Let's understand what vouch limits are for and what they are.
Limits are needed to restrict the size of the [`vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L346) and `vouchIdsByAuthor` arrays.
Limits are checked when an author creates a new vouch 
```solidity
if (vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId].length >= maximumVouches) {
      revert MaximumVouchesExceeded(
        vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId].length,
        "Exceeds author vouch limit"
      );
    }
...
if (vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId].length >= maximumVouches) {
      revert MaximumVouchesExceeded(
        vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId].length,
        "Exceeds subject vouch limit"
      );
    }
```
However, let's look at what happens if maximumVouches decreases as a result of calling the function
```solidity
function updateMaximumVouches(uint256 maximumVouches_) external onlyAdmin whenNotPaused {
    if (maximumVouches_ > 256) {
      revert MaximumVouchesExceeded(maximumVouches_, "Maximum vouches cannot exceed 256");
    }
    maximumVouches = maximumVouches_;
  }
```
Specifically, what happens to users whose vouchIdsByAuthor arrays have more than the set limit. 
Let's say at first the limit was 256, the author vouch 250 times, however afterwards the limit was lowered to 240.

In this case, such an author will be forced to forcefully close a certain number of vouchs, which incurs a loss of funds for him, protocol, those he vouchs for


### Root Cause

One variable is responsible for two limits

### Internal pre-conditions

- The user must make the number of vouch less than the current limit (X)

- The limit must decrease enough to become less than X

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

In the first place, such a forced reduction in vouch carries losses for all parties to the protocol.

Secondly, a user in this protocol will not be able to simply create a new address and ignore the limit exceeded on the previous one, because everything is tied to profiles.

I think in this context the error deserves medium severity

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Enter separate limits for each array so that reducing the limit to one does not affect the other.

The limit for the author's vote array can be made fixed so that such problems do not arise.
