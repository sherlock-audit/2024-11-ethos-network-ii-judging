# In the `ReputationMarket.sellVotes` function, `marketFunds[profileId]` should contain protocol exit fee

### Summary

In the `ReputationMarket.sellVotes` function, it subtracts `fundsReceived` which does not contains procotol fee into `marketFunds[profileId]`.
In the `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` function, it transfers `marketFunds[profileId]` amount of ethers to authorized graduation withdrawal address. This means the contract transfers protocol exit fee twice.
As a result, this causes the protocol's loss of funds.

### Root Cause

In the `ReputationMarket._calculateSell` function, `fundsReceived` does not contain `protocolFee` from [L1041](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/tree/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1041).

```solidity
L1041:    (fundsReceived, protocolFee, ) = previewFees(fundsReceived, false);
```

In the `ReputationMarket.sellVotes` function, it transfers protocol fee to `protocolFeeAddress` from L517.
And `fundsReceived` is subtracted from the `marketFunds[profileId]` variable from L522.

```solidity
L517:    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);
L522:    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
```

In the `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` function, it transfers `marketFunds[profileId]` amount of ethers to authorized graduation withdrawal address.

```solidity
L675:    _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]);
```

As a result, it tries to transfer fee amount of ethers, too.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

1. None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

This causes the protocol's loss of funds.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

It is recommended to change the code in the `sellVotes` function as following:

```diff
-    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
+    marketFunds[profileId] -= (fundsReceived + protocolFee);
```
