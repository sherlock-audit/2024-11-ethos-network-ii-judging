# Incorrect fee calculation in EthosVouch::calcFee()

### Summary

In `EthosVouch` there are 4 different fees that can be set by the protocol that are applied when an author vouches, increases their vouch, or unvouches. The amount to charge for each type of fee is calculated by `EthosVouch::calcFee`. A logical error in this calculation always undercharges fees (e.g. a 5% fee only gets charged at ~4.7%).

### Root Cause

The `feeBasisPoints` is added to the denominator instead of being subtracted from the numerator:

### Internal pre-conditions

1. At least 1 of the 4 fees is set to a non-zero amount
2. A user vouches, increases their vouch, or unvouches so that `calcFee()` is called

### External pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

1. The protocol sets one or more fees (e.g., protocol fee = 500 basis points or 5%)
2. A user interacts with the contract in one of three ways:
- Creates a new vouch 
- Increases an existing vouch
- Unvouches 
3. `applyFees` is called which calls `calcFee()` for each fee type.
4. `calcFee()` incorrectly calculates the fee amount consistently undercharging

### Impact

Loss of funds for the protocol, subject, and previous vouchers depending on what fees are non-zero and whether vouching, increasing a vouch, or unvouching is occurring.

### PoC

To run the POC:
1. Initialize a Foundry repo
2. `forge install https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts.git`
3. Create a new .t.sol file in /test/ and then paste the code below
8. Run `forge test --mt testCalcFeeTest -vv`

pragma solidity ^0.8.26;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import { Math } from "../lib/openzeppelin-contracts/contracts/utils/math/Math.sol";

contract CalcFeeTest is Test {
    using Math for uint256;
    uint256 constant BASIS_POINT_SCALE = 10000;

    function testCalcFeeTest() public pure {
        // Test with 5% fee (500 basis points), so fee amount should be 5 ether
        uint256 total = 100 ether;
        uint256 feeBasisPoints = 500; // 5%

        // this line is what calcFee() returns
        uint256 feeAmount = total - (total.mulDiv(BASIS_POINT_SCALE, (BASIS_POINT_SCALE + feeBasisPoints), Math.Rounding.Floor));

        // this is the correct implementation of a 5% fee
        uint256 correctFeeAmount = total - (total.mulDiv(BASIS_POINT_SCALE - feeBasisPoints, BASIS_POINT_SCALE, Math.Rounding.Floor));
        
        console.log("Fee amount:", feeAmount);
        console.log("Correct fee amount:", correctFeeAmount);
        
        assertLt(feeAmount, correctFeeAmount);
        assertEq(correctFeeAmount, 5 ether);
    }
}

### Mitigation

Update:

```diff
function calcFee(uint256 total, uint256 feeBasisPoints) internal pure returns (uint256 fee) {
    /*
     * Formula derivation:
     * 1. total = deposit + fee
     * 2. fee = deposit * (feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 3. total = deposit + deposit * (feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 4. total = deposit * (1 + feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 5. deposit = total / (1 + feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 6. fee = total - deposit
     * 7. fee = total - (total * 10000 / (10000 + feeBasisPoints))
     */
    return
      total -
-      (total.mulDiv(BASIS_POINT_SCALE, (BASIS_POINT_SCALE + feeBasisPoints), Math.Rounding.Floor));
+      (total.mulDiv(BASIS_POINT_SCALE - feeBasisPoints, (BASIS_POINT_SCALE), Math.Rounding.Floor));
