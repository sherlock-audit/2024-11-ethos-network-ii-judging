# When users increase their vouch they will receive some part of the fees that thei've paid

### Summary

Doing `vouchByAddress` then `increaseVouch` would be more beneficial for users as they would receive some part of the entry fee. Thus users can exploit this to get some part of their paid fee back and lower the fees for the rest of the users.

This happens as `increaseVouch` would `applyFees` and since our user would own some percentage of the total vouch balance, he would be entitled to that % of the fees.

```solidity
  function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable nonReentrant {
    // ...
    (uint256 toDeposit, ) = applyFees(msg.value, true, subjectProfileId);
  }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L949
```solidity
  function applyFees(...) internal returns (uint256 toDeposit, uint256 totalFees) {
     // ... 
      if (vouchersPoolFee > 0) {
        vouchersPoolFee = _rewardPreviousVouchers(vouchersPoolFee, subjectProfileId);
      }
```

```solidity
   function _rewardPreviousVouchers(...) internal returns (uint256 amountDistributed) {
    // ...
    uint256 remainingRewards = amount;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalVouches && remainingRewards > 0; i++) {
      Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];
      if (!vouch.archived) {
        //@autism since our user already has `vouch.balance` he would receive % of the fees he pays
        // amount * balance / totalBalance
        uint256 reward = amount.mulDiv(vouch.balance, totalBalance, Math.Rounding.Floor);
        if (reward > 0) {
          vouch.balance += reward;
          remainingRewards -= reward;
        }
      }
    }
```

See `Attack Path` for a good example

### Root Cause

`applyFees` acting as weights, distributing to all users
Users receiving rewards for their own vouching

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

Users to first `vouchByAddress` then `increaseVouch`

### Attack Path

Bob has 9 ETH vouched to him

Normal case
1. Alice vouches 20 ETH to Bob, where 10% of that goes to the rest of the vouchers
2. Alice has vouched 18 ETH to Bob (2 ETH paid as fee)

Attack
1. Alice vouches 10 ETH to Bob (1 ETH fee)
2. Bob has 18 ETH vouched for him (50% is from Alice - 9 ETH)
3. Alice vouches again 10 ETH to Bob (sending 1 ETH as rewards)
4. However since Alice holds 50% of his vouches (9 ETH) she claims 50% of the fees (0.5 ETH)


First scenario Alice vouched 20ETH and pays 2 ETH fees, as it should.
Second scenario Alice vouched 20ETH and pays only 1.5 ETH in fees.

Note that the more the vouch increase is split between TX the more our user will save on fees.

### Impact

Users can reduce the fees they pay. They also steal some fees from the rest of the vouchers

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider not returning any fees to `msg.sender` who increases it's vouch.
