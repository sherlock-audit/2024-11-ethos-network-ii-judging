# Incorrect check of `msg.sender` in the `unvouch` function

### Summary

In the `EthosVouch` contract, the `unvouch` function checks whether `msg.sender` is the creator of the vouch, not check that the vouch belongs to `msg.sender` like `increaseVouch` function.

This incorrect check can lead to DoS to unvouch.

In the `EthosProfile.sol` contract, several addresses can share the same profile.

```solidity
// Maps a user's address to their profile ID for quick lookups. This includes removed addresses; do not rely on it for verification.
  mapping(address => uint256) public profileIdByAddress;
```

Users cannot unvouch with another address which shares the same profile.

### Root Cause

```solidity
@>      if (vouches[vouchId].authorAddress != msg.sender) {
           revert AddressNotVouchAuthor(vouchId, msg.sender, vouches[vouchId].authorAddress);
        }
```
