# Vouchers can unvouch to avoid slashing

### Summary

`slash()` skips `archived` (unvouched; which by that time will have balance = 0) vouches. Slashing event occurs some time after a whistleblower reports/pledges unethical behavior, a malicious author will have plenty of time to unvouch his funds if he knows he is likely to be slashed.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L452

```solidity
function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
...

@> v.archived = true;
..
@> v.balance = 0;
...
}


function slash(
uint256 authorProfileId,
uint256 slashBasisPoints
) external onlySlasher whenNotPaused nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
...
// Only slash active vouches
@> if (!vouch.archived) {
    uint256 slashAmount = vouch.balance.mulDiv(
      slashBasisPoints,
      BASIS_POINT_SCALE,
      Math.Rounding.Floor
    );
    if (slashAmount > 0) {
      vouch.balance -= slashAmount;
      totalSlashed += slashAmount;
    }
}
...

```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Wait for accusation, unvouch.

### Impact

Malicious users can avoid slashing penalty by paying the exit fee, whistleblowers won't get their reward.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Unvouch can be timelocked, and activated only after enough time has passed/no pending accusations.
