# Admin remove marketConfig may cause users to create markets with incorrect configurations

### Summary

The `removeMarketConfig` function of ReputationMarket will cause the market configuration index to shift, then users creating markets may cause incorrect configuration access.

### Root Cause

- In [ReputationMarket.sol:405](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L405) When removing a configuration, the current configuration and the last configuration are swapped, and the current configuration index points to the last configuration.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to remove the configuration that is not the last index. 

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The user was about to create a market with configuration x and the admin removes configuration x at this time. 
2. The user unknowingly created a market with the index of configuration x.

### Impact

Configurations specify the volatility and stability of reputation markets, and once a user market is created, the configuration cannot be changed:
- If a market is accidentally created with a primary configuration, low initial votes may result in large price fluctuations, which may cause early investors to lose funds and further reduce the user's reputation
- If a market is accidentally created with an advanced configuration, the initial liquidity requirements are higher, resulting in more user funds being locked than expected

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Specify configuration using id instead of index
