# Protocol gets less fees than expected due to wrong fee formula calculation

### Summary

The incorrect fee calculation in the code will cause a loss of revenue for the protocol, and the other recipients of fees, as the function `calcFee()` will miscalculate the fees deducted from transactions.

### Root Cause

In `packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol`, the fee calculation formula is flawed. Specifically, at the following line:

[Github Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L986-L988)

current fee formula:

```solidity
return
  total -
  (total.mulDiv(BASIS_POINT_SCALE, (BASIS_POINT_SCALE + feeBasisPoints), Math.Rounding.Floor)); // @audit wrong formula calculation
```



The issue arises because the formula does not correctly account for the fee basis points, leading to an inaccurate deduction of fees.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Imagine the following scenario:

We have total amount 1 ether, feeBasisPoints 500, BASIS_POINT_SCALE is 10000, the fee would be:

1 ether - 1 ether * 10_000 / 10_500 = 0,04761905 ether instead of 0,005 ether

The fee is 4,761905 % instead of 5 %, and the difference is around 0.24 %.



### Impact

The protocol gets a reduced revenue due to the miscalculation of fees. This error means that the fees deducted from transactions are lower than intended, leading to a loss of funds that should have been collected. 

Also, the `donationFee`, `vouchersPoolFee` and the `exitFee` are calculated with the function wrong formula in `calcFee()`, so these fees would also be decreased.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To fix the issue, the fee calculation should be revised to use the following formula instead:

```solidity
return total.mulDiv(feeBasisPoints, BASIS_POINT_SCALE, Math.Rounding.Floor)
```


This adjustment ensures that the fees are calculated correctly.
