# User is able to `increaseVouch` even when contracts are paused

### Summary

Inside `EthosVouch`, every function that changes the state of the contract has the`whenNotPaused` modifier, except [`EthosVouch::increaseVouch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426).
This allows the user to change the contract state even when paused.
