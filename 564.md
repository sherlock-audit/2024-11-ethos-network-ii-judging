# some discrepancy between code and documentation

### Summary

there are some discrepancy between the code and the documentation regarding certain values and calculations. These issues include incorrect calculations that affect critical values, such as initial liquidity and fee limits, which could result in unintended functionality if not addressed. 

### Root Cause

In the `ReputationMarket` contract, the `initialLiquidity` is calculated as multiples of `DEFAULT_PRICE`. However, the calculation seems incorrect based on the associated comments in the documentation. The issue arises in the way the `initialLiquidity` values are assigned in each market tier, as it doesnâ€™t match the expectations set by the documentation.

Default tier: initialLiquidity: 2 * DEFAULT_PRICE,  // Expected: 0.002 ETH, Actual: 0.02 ETH
Deluxe tier: initialLiquidity: 50 * DEFAULT_PRICE,  // Expected: 0.05 ETH, Actual: 0.5 ETH
Premium tier: initialLiquidity: 100 * DEFAULT_PRICE,  // Expected: 0.1 ETH, Actual: 1 ETH




Fee Limit Discrepancy in `EthosVouch`:
The documentation specifies that the maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%. However, the constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES is set to 10000, which, if treated as a percentage, would imply a 100% fee limit, not 10%.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol?plain=1#L120

uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;


### Impact

discrepancy between code and documentation. while does not have direct impact on protocol, its against the invariant that is in contest readme.md and could cause problem due to mistake by [trusted] admin:
