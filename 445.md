# Incorrect fee calculation will overcharge users buying votes.

### Summary

In `ReputationMarket` users buying votes provide an input amount, but only a portion may be needed for the actual vote purchase - any excess is returned to them. However, the entry fee is incorrectly calculated on the total provided amount rather than the actual invested amount (amount used for votes purchase). This results in users paying higher fees than they should.

### Root Cause

In  [_calculateBuy()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L960), fees are calculated on the entire input amount before determining how many votes can actually be purchased. While this ensures sufficient funds are reserved for fees, it results in users being overcharged when only a portion of their input amount is used for voting. The fees should be recalculated based on the actual amount spent on votes, with the excess fees included in the user's refund.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to set the entry protocol fee
2. Admin needs to set the donation fee

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Users call [buyVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442)

### Impact

Due to incorrect fee calculations, users, when purchasing votes, are charged 10-60% more in fees than they should be, which represents an additional 1-6% of their provided amount (assuming a 10% total entry fee).

### PoC

Add this test in test/reputationMarket/rep.fees.test.ts


```javascript
describe('PoC', () => {
    it('should charge user more fee than it should', async () => {
      const feeBasisPoint = 500 // 5%
      await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints(feeBasisPoint);
      await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setDonationBasisPoints(feeBasisPoint);

      // Picked so that the change amount is close to the max vote price
      const buyAmount = ethers.parseEther('0.0129629'); // To check the lower limits use numbers >=0.01296299 and <=0.012963
      const {
        simulatedVotesBought,
        simulatedFundsPaid,
        simulatedNewVotePrice,
        simulatedProtocolFee,
        simulatedDonation,
        simulatedMinVotePrice,
        simulatedMaxVotePrice } = await userA.simulateBuy({ buyAmount });

      const actualFee = simulatedProtocolFee + simulatedDonation;
      const netFundsPaid = simulatedFundsPaid - actualFee;
      const actualChange = buyAmount - simulatedFundsPaid; // Change returned to the user
      console.log('Simulated funds paid: ', ethers.formatEther(simulatedFundsPaid)); // This includes the fee
      console.log('Simulated net funds paid: ', ethers.formatEther(netFundsPaid));
      console.log('Change returned to the user: ', ethers.formatEther(actualChange));
      console.log('Simulated Max Vote Price: ', ethers.formatEther(simulatedMaxVotePrice));



      const expectedEntryFee = (netFundsPaid * BigInt(feeBasisPoint)) / BASIS_POINTS;
      const expectedDonationFee = (netFundsPaid * BigInt(feeBasisPoint)) / BASIS_POINTS;
      const expectedFee = expectedEntryFee + expectedDonationFee;
      const expectedChange = buyAmount - netFundsPaid - expectedFee;

      console.log('Expected fee: ', ethers.formatEther(expectedFee));
      console.log('Actual fee: ', ethers.formatEther(actualFee));

      console.log('Expected change: ', ethers.formatEther(expectedChange));
      console.log('Actual change: ', ethers.formatEther(actualChange));

      console.log('Bips higher fee: ', (actualFee - expectedFee) * BASIS_POINTS / actualFee);
      console.log('Fee diff to provided amount: ', (actualFee - expectedFee) * BASIS_POINTS / buyAmount);
    });
  });
```

### Mitigation

One possible solution:

```diff
  function _calculateBuy(
    Market memory market,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 funds
  )
    private
    view
    returns (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      uint256 newVotePrice,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    )
  {
    uint256 fundsAvailable;
    (fundsAvailable, protocolFee, donation) = previewFees(funds, true);
    uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);

    uint256 minPrice = votePrice;
    uint256 maxPrice;

    if (fundsAvailable < votePrice) {
      revert InsufficientFunds();
    }

    while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
      fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
      fundsPaid += votePrice;
      votesBought++;

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    }
+   (, protocolFee, donation) = previewFees(fundsPaid, true);
    fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;

    maxPrice = votePrice;

    return (votesBought, fundsPaid, votePrice, protocolFee, donation, minPrice, maxPrice);
  }
```
