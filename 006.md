# `buyVotes` function will overcharge users with fee

### Summary

The `buyVotes` function will charge fee based on the msg.value instead of the amount used for purchasing the vote. As a result it will always overcharge users.

### Root Cause

`buyVotes` function we see that the msg.value is passed in `_calculateBuy`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L459
After that he we can see that the protocol fee is taken proportionally from the amount here:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1146
However this amount will be the msg.value, which will always have an unused prortion.
As a result the fee will also be applied to the unused amount.

### Attack Path

 Consider the following scenario(protocolFee=donationFee=5%; 10% in total):
1. A user supplies 1e18 eth as msg.value in the transaction.
2. The vote cost is 0.5e18 eth. And the user will tolerate slippage as long as they receive one vote.
3. With the current implementation the fee will be 0.1e18(10% of 1e18)
4. The user will be able to buy only one vote and will be refunded:
1e18-0.5e18(vote cost)-0.1e18(for the fees) = 0.4e18 =>total spent will be 0.6e18
However in this case the fee was taken from the msg.value 
Now lets see what would have happened if the user supplied the exact amount - 0.6e18 with the same vote cost
 - The fee will be 10% of 0.6e18 = 0.06e18
 - the vote cost will be the same for the example - 0.5e18
 Now however the user will be refunded 0.6e18 - 0.06e18(total fees)-0.5e18(vote cost) = 0.04e18 refund amount => totalSpent = 0.56e18.
We can see that if the user supplies more msg.value for the same amount of votes they will be charged more fee

### Impact

The `buyVotes` function will always overcharge fees - High

### Mitigation

The fee should be calculated based on the amount used for buying the votes, not the amount provided.
