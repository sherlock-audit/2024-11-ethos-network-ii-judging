# The market contract had some incorrect hard-coded configuration when it was initialized.

### Summary

The market contract had some incorrect hard-coded configuration when it was initialized.
For example, the comment states that the initial Liquidity is 0.002ETH, but it is actually set to 0.02ETH.
```solidity
  // --- Constants ---
  uint256 public constant DEFAULT_PRICE = 0.01 ether;

    // Default tier
    // - Minimum viable liquidity for small/new markets
    // - 0.002 ETH initial liquidity
    // - 1 vote each for trust/distrust (volatile price at low volume)
    marketConfigs.push(
      MarketConfig({
        initialLiquidity: 2 * DEFAULT_PRICE, // 0.02 ether
        initialVotes: 1,
        basePrice: DEFAULT_PRICE
      })
    );
```

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket.sol#L79](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L79) , DEFAULT_PRICE = 0.01 ether.
In [ReputationMarket.sol#L219-L252](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L219-L252), three incorrect configurations were set.
