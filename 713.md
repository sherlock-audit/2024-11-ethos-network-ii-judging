# `_createMarket` could coincide with `removeMarketConfig` causing user to create market with a different config type

## Vulnerability Details

In `ReputationMarket.sol`,

`removeMarketConfig` removes a market config type template that the user can create. If the type it is trying to remove isnt the last element, it will shift the last element to the index it wants to remove, then pop the last element.

**Importantly, it causes the indexes of config types to change.**

Creating a market with an allowed user through `createMarketWithConfig` requires the whitelisted user to pass in just the index of the market config that needs to be created.

Hence, when these 2 functions are called around the same time, a user will end up creating a market config type that is different than intended and it will be **permanent**.

## Proof Of Concept

Suppose current market types are:
1. `A` (initial liquidity = 3 ether)
2. `B` (initial liquidity = 3 ether)
3. `C` (initial liquidity = 2 ether)

If `removeMarketConfig(0)` and `createMarketWithConfig(0)` are called around the same time:

`removeMarketConfig(0)` will put `C` at index 0.

Then `createMarketWithConfig(0)` will end up creating a market with `C` instead of reverting. (The extra 1 ether of msg.value provided (since 3-2=1) will just be refunded to the user via `_sendEth`)

Instead, the function should have reverted as if A was not available, the user of the profile may want to choose config type `B` instead.

## Impact
Since votes[TRUST] and votes[DISTRUST] will be set to the initial votes that is >= 1. And it is impossible to sell to < 1.

votes will then forever be >= 1 for that profile and it becomes impossible to call create market with a different market config type for that profile ever again, (since it will js revert with market exists) hence this is **permanent**.

It will eventually cause fund loss for the user as market config types are meant to be chosen by the user to match the volatility that the user predicts their own market will be. 

If this bug ends up force creating a different market config for the user that is less suitable for their expected volatility, then eventually voters who participate will have less than ideal fund profits/loss and the owner of the profile has to **invest more money** to stabilise and improve reputation.

## Recommendation
When creating market, other than just passing in the index of the market config, add the actual market config as the parameter itself so that it will revert in this case.
