# Slashing Can Be Frontrun

### Summary

Slashing which is a mechanism in [ethosvouch.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L520C1-L545C6) allows a user with only slashrole to slash a %of the author's vouches (less than 10%). This slashing process can be a `frontrun` by [unvouch and unvouchUnhealthy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L453) function to withdraw the money before getting slashed.


### Likelihood : Medium 
### Impact: High  -> The protocol loses all of its penalities

Severity : Medium 

### Root Cause

The root cause of the frontrunning vulnerability stems from the ability of actors (e.g., authors of vouches) to modify contract state after the slashing process is initiated but before it's executed on-chain. Specifically, because transactions are visible in the mempool before being mined, an author can detect a pending slashing transaction and:

### Attack Path


Bob is a malicious user 
1. Alice with slasher role tries to slash Bob which has many vouches 
2. Bob sees this pathway and tries to unvouch all the vouches in a single transaction and sends some extrafees so that the transaction of the Bob is executed first.
3. As now vouches from bob will be in archieved state, Slashing mechanism can't be done 

### Impact

1. Malicious authors can preemptively archive their vouches or reduce their vouch.balance before the slashing transaction is mined, rendering the slashing process ineffective.
2. The protocol may fail to collect intended penalties, leading to potential financial losses and undermining the economic incentives designed to encourage good behavior.
3. Bad actors can avoid penalties for misconduct, compromising the security and integrity of the system

### Mitigation

Try to use a private mempool to do slashing
