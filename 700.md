# anyone can mark unhealthy leading to Griefing attack

### Summary

markUnhealthy() function allows anyone with a valid Ethos profile to mark any unvouched vouch as unhealthy, without providing any justification or proof

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L883C1-L888C1
Provide a gas stipend to the call to handle potential gas costs in the recipient contract's fallback function: .call{value: amount, gas: gasLimit}(""). Carefully choose the gas limit (gasLimit). Too little will still cause failures, while too much could be exploited by malicious receivers.


Instead of simply reverting, consider emitting an event to log the failed transfer and the amount. This allows for manual intervention or alternative handling of the lost fees. Combine this with a multi-sig controlled function to recover or redirect the lost funds.

Example Attack Scenario:

- Alice has a reputable profile with several vouches.
- Bob, a competitor or someone with a grudge against Alice, decides to damage her reputation.
- Bob identifies Alice's unvouched vouches.
- Bob calls markUnhealthy() for each of Alice's unvouched vouches, without providing any real reason.
- Alice's profile now shows several unhealthy vouches, potentially affecting her standing within the Ethos community.

### Mitigation

 using a pull-based payment system where the protocol fee address can withdraw accumulated fees when needed. This avoids the potential for lost fees due to recipient contract issues and minimizes gas costs
