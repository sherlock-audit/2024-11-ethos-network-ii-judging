# Reentrancy Vulnerability in `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` Allows Contract Draining

### Summary

The withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds function in the contract contains a reentrancy vulnerability. The _sendEth() function is called before resetting the marketFunds[profileId] value to 0. This allows a malicious contract to reenter the function and repeatedly withdraw funds associated with the same profileId, potentially draining the contract's funds.

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket.sol:675](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L675) is sent `arketFunds[profileId]` wei which assume is not zero. 
In [ReputationMarket.sol:677](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L677) it is reset to zero, but before it can be recalled and `arketFunds[profileId]` will have old, not updated value.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Authorized account try to take more eth than it should.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates contract which has implemented receive() and implement calling `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` funciton in it.
2. It calls function `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds`.
3. Function is recalled and eth is transferred to the contract

### Impact

The contract may be drained(ETH only) if wrong contract will be passed as trusted.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

reinit value to new variable and reset `marketFunds[profileId]` before sending ether to the sender.
