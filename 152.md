# `EthosVouch::increaseVouch` does not implement the `whenNotPaused` Modifier, if needed for the contract to be paused during an emergency, users will still be able to deposit more eth in active vouches which may lead to unnessary loss of funds for users

### Summary

The `increaseVouch` function lacks the `whenNotPaused` modifier seen in functions like `vouchByProfileId` and `Unvouch`, which could expose users to potential financial risks during critical contract states or known exploits. This oversight allows continued vouch increases even when the contract should be halted, potentially leading to unnecessary fund exposure or user losses.

### Root Cause

In [`EthosVouch.sol:426`,](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426-L444) while similar vouch interaction functions are protected by the whenNotPaused modifier, the `increaseVouch` function remains unprotected by the modifier. This creates an asymmetric pause mechanism that:

1. Allows vouch increases during potential security incidents
2. Bypasses intended emergency stop controls
3. Leaves users vulnerable to continuing interactions during known exploit scenarios

### Internal pre-conditions

1. An admin having paused the contract during an exploit to halt any further financial operations.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The protocol faces an attack and the admin chooses to pause the contract to halt any further financial operations and the protocol and protect users from further financial loss.
2. Users unknowingly increase vouch amounts during the security event
3. Continued fund exposure during critical vulnerability windows
4. Circumvention of intended emergency control mechanisms

### Impact

Users potentially losing much more than they would have if protocol is compromised and this function is still open.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include the `whenNotPaused` modifier in the `increaseVouch` function to protect users from unforeseen events:

```solidity
 function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    // vouch increases much also meet the minimum vouch amount
    if (msg.value < configuredMinimumVouchAmount) {
      revert MinimumVouchAmount(configuredMinimumVouchAmount);
    }
    // get the profile id of the author
    uint256 profileId = IEthosProfile(
      contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
    ).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);
    _vouchShouldBelongToAuthor(vouchId, profileId);
    // make sure this vouch is active; not unvouched
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);

    uint256 subjectProfileId = vouches[vouchId].subjectProfileId;
    (uint256 toDeposit, ) = applyFees(msg.value, true, subjectProfileId);
    vouches[vouchId].balance += toDeposit;

    emit VouchIncreased(vouchId, profileId, subjectProfileId, msg.value);
  }
```
