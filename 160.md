# # Invalid `marketFunds[profileId]`(sellVotes())


### Summary
`marketFunds[profileId]`s calculation is incorrect.

### Root Cause
In the `sellVotes()` function, `marketFunds[profileId]` is decreased without accounting for the fees.

### Internal pre-conditions
N/A

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Attack Path
N/A

### Impact
The value of `marketFunds[profileId]` is decreased without including the protocol fees. 
As a result, `marketFunds[profileId]` is greater than actual funds currently invested in this market.
Consequently, the `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()` function will withdraw more than intended, which may prevent others from being able to withdraw their funds.
Additionally, votes may not be sold due to insufficient funds.

### PoC
```solidity
ReputationMarket.sol
660:    function withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(uint256 profileId) public whenNotPaused {
            address authorizedAddress = contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(
                "GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL"
            );
            if (msg.sender != authorizedAddress) {
                revert UnauthorizedWithdrawal();
            }
            _checkMarketExists(profileId);
            if (!graduatedMarkets[profileId]) {
                revert MarketNotGraduated();
            }
            if (marketFunds[profileId] == 0) {
                revert InsufficientFunds();
            }

675:        _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]);
            emit MarketFundsWithdrawn(profileId, msg.sender, marketFunds[profileId]);
            marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
        }

495:    function sellVotes(
            uint256 profileId,
            bool isPositive,
            uint256 amount
        ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
            [...]
517:        applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

            // send the proceeds to the seller
            _sendEth(fundsReceived);
            // tally market funds
522:        marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
            [...]
        }
```
In the `sellVotes()` function, `marketFunds[profileId]` is only decreased by the funds sent to the seller, excluding protocol fees.

### Mitigation
```solidity
ReputationMarket.sol
495:    function sellVotes(
            uint256 profileId,
            bool isPositive,
            uint256 amount
        ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
            [...]
517:        applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

            // send the proceeds to the seller
            _sendEth(fundsReceived);
            // tally market funds
-           marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
+           marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived + protocolFee;
            [...]
        }
```
