# Missing slippage protection on `sellVotes()`

### Summary

The `ReputationMarket` contract provides preview functions ([simulateBuy()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L761) and [simulateSell()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L806)) to estimate outcomes before actual transactions ([buyVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442) and [sellVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495)). While [buyVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442) includes slippage protection against price changes between simulation and execution, [sellVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495) lacks this safeguard. While Base L2's private mempool prevents traditional frontrunning, users are still exposed to two risks:

1. Market volatility between simulation and execution could result in receiving fewer funds than expected
2. The sequencer prioritizes transactions with higher fees ([ref](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/differences#mempool-rules)), allowing users paying higher fees to execute trades first, potentially leading to unfavorable price movements for pending transactions with lower fees.

### Root Cause

[sellVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495) is missing slippage protection.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls `simulateSell()` to preview expected returns
2. Market experiences high sell volume, causing price decline
3. User submits `sellVotes()` transaction with outdated price expectations
4. Due to missing slippage protection, transaction executes at significantly lower price than simulated, resulting in unexpected losses

### Impact

Loss of assets for the affected users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a slippage control that allows the users to revert if the amount they received is less than the amount they expected.
