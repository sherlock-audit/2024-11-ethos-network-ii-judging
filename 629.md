### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

- increaseVouch() does not check the protocol is in pause state or not.
- Various other functions like vouchByProfileId() , unVouch() , claimRewards() checks that the protocol is in pause state or not.
- They have forgotten to check pause state for increaseVouch()
- As vouch() and claim and unvouch doesn't work when protocol is in pause state so this function should also not work.

### Impact

- Even when protocol is in pause state people can use increaseVouch() which is not intended as all the functions like vouch() , unvouch() , claimRewards() doesn't work when the protocol is in pause state.

### PoC

### Mitigation

 Put whenNotPaused modifier inside increaseVouch()
