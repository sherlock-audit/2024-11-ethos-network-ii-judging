# Incorrect Vouch Data Retrieval After Unvouching

### Summary

View functions may become unusable or return incorrect vouch data due to mapping issues after unvouching. When a user unvouches, the `vouchIdByAuthorForSubjectProfileId` mapping deletes, leading to potential inconsistencies. This can cause the view functions to either fail outright or return incorrect vouch data.


### Root Cause

In the unvouch function, while the vouch is marked as archived and removed from arrays, the mapping `vouchIdByAuthorForSubjectProfileId` is deleted.

```javascript
function _removeVouchFromArrays(Vouch storage v) private {
    ... SNIP ...
    // the author->subject mapping is only for active vouches; remove it
    delete vouchIdByAuthorForSubjectProfileId[v.authorProfileId][v.subjectProfileId];
}
```

The issue arises when `verifiedVouchByAuthorForSubjectProfileId` or `verifiedVouchByAuthorForSubjectAddress` functions are called.

These functions retrieve the vouchId using:

```javascript
uint256 id = vouchIdByAuthorForSubjectProfileId[author][subjectProfileId];
```

If the vouch has been unvouched, this id is 0, as the mapping is deleted during unvouching. Then, the function performs checks:

```javascript
_vouchShouldBelongToAuthor(id, author);
if (vouches[id].subjectProfileId != subjectProfileId) {
  revert WrongSubjectProfileIdForVouch(id, subjectProfileId);
}
```

Since id is 0, this part most likely revert since the vouch with id = 0 most likely does not belong to the author or subject profile id is different. even if the revert does not occur for some reason (if author is first user ever vouched and subjects is same and ...), the function incorrectly return the vouch with id = 0.

this issue also exists in `vouchExistsFor` function which retrieve vouch id the same way. 

### Internal pre-conditions

- A user must unvouch.


### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

- The user vouches for a subject profile
- The user then unvouches, marking the vouch as archived and deleting the `vouchIdByAuthorForSubjectProfileId` mapping for that subject profile
- When the user or another party attempts to call `verifiedVouchByAuthorForSubjectProfileId` or `verifiedVouchByAuthorForSubjectAddress` for that subject profile, the function will revert.


### Impact

Both the `verifiedVouchByAuthorForSubjectProfileId` and `verifiedVouchByAuthorForSubjectAddress` functions will become unusable for users who have unvouched subject profile. Users and third parties relying on these view functions to retrieve vouch data will be unable to do so, leading to potential misinformation and a loss of trust in the system.
