# Market Funds Accounting Issue

### Summary

The `ReputationMarket` contract contains a critical accounting error in the handling of market funds. The marketFunds tracking mechanism incorrectly includes protocol fees and donations in its calculations, leading to a mismatch between the recorded funds and actual available balance.



### Root Cause

The issue stems from the handling of fundsPaid when users interact with the contract through the buyVotes and sellVotes functions:

1. Buying Votes (buyVotes)
- The marketFunds[profileId] variable is updated with the total fundsPaid amount, which includes protocol fees and donations.
- However, fees and donations should not be treated as market funds since they are immediately redirected elsewhere.

```solidity
 // Determine how many votes can be bought with the funds provided
    (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);

   // ...

    // Calculate and refund remaining funds
    uint256 refund = msg.value - fundsPaid;
    if (refund > 0) _sendEth(refund);

    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
```

2. Selling Votes (sellVotes)
- Conversely, when users sell votes, the contract deducts only the fundsReceived from marketFunds[profileId].
- This means protocol fees are not subtracted from marketFunds, leading to an inflated balance.

```solidity
    (
      uint256 votesSold,
      uint256 fundsReceived,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);

    // update the market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;

    // apply protocol fees
    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

    // send the proceeds to the seller
    _sendEth(fundsReceived);
    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
```


### Internal pre-conditions

1. Protocol fees or donation fee should be set
3. Users should buy or sell votes

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. If the contract happens to have enough total balance (from other markets), the withdrawal would succeed but would incorrectly use funds belonging to other markets.
2.  Some markets might become unable to withdraw their funds if the contract's total balance is insufficient due to the inflated accounting.

### PoC

Inside  contracts/test/reputationMarket/rep.graduate.test.ts

```solidity
    it('should fail when withdrawing funds from graduated market', async () => {

      // Set rotocol fees
      await reputationMarket.connect(graduator).setProtocolFeeAddress(ethers.Wallet.createRandom().address);
      await reputationMarket.connect(graduator).setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints(500);

      let initialFunds = await reputationMarket.marketFunds(DEFAULT.profileId);
      expect(await reputationMarket.marketFunds(DEFAULT.profileId)).to.equal(initialFunds);

      // Add funds through trading
      await userA.buyVotes({ buyAmount: ethers.parseEther('1') });

      // Contract balance should be greater than market funds but protocol fees sent to admin
      // And marketFunds updated incorrectly
      const marketFunds = await reputationMarket.marketFunds(DEFAULT.profileId);
      const contractBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(reputationMarket.getAddress());
      expect(marketFunds).to.greaterThan(contractBalance);

      // Graduate market
      await reputationMarket.connect(graduator).graduateMarket(DEFAULT.profileId);
      // Withdraw funds fails because marketFunds is incorrect and bigger than contract balance
      await expect(reputationMarket.connect(graduator).withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(DEFAULT.profileId)).to.be.revertedWith('ETH transfer failed');
  });
```

### Mitigation

Add explicit accounting for fees

```solidity
function buyVotes(...) {
    (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);

    // Update market funds with actual available amount (excluding fees)
+    uint256 funds= fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation
     marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid; 
    
    // Rest of the function...
}
```
