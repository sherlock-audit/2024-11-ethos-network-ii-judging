# Exit fee is applied incorrectly leading to protocol losing a part of exit fee

### Summary

The exit fee is the fee applied when a user `unvouch()`. The calculation however is incorrect as the exit fee should apply to the total amount invested and not on the left over amount after deducting protocol, donation and voucher pool fee. The method `checkFeeExceedsMaximum()` checks if the total fees is <=100%. It states that the exit fee should apply on total amount.

```solidity
  /* @notice Checks if the new fee would cause the total fees to exceed the maximum allowed
   * @dev This function is called before updating any fee to ensure the total doesn't exceed MAX_TOTAL_FEES
   * @param currentFee The current value of the fee being updated
   * @param newFee The proposed new value for the fee
   */
  function checkFeeExceedsMaximum(uint256 currentFee, uint256 newFee) internal view {
    uint256 totalFees = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints +
      exitFeeBasisPoints +
      entryDonationFeeBasisPoints +
      entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints +
      newFee -
      currentFee;
    if (totalFees > MAX_TOTAL_FEES) revert FeesExceedMaximum(totalFees, MAX_TOTAL_FEES);
  }
```

### Root Cause

In `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L955`, the exit Fee calculated is as follows
```solidity
uint256 exitFee = calcFee(amount, exitFeeBasisPoints);
```

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

For example if the deposit amount is 100 and (protocol fee + donation fee + voucher fee) is 10%. Then the deposit amount in a vouch is 90. Now, when the user unvouch(). If the exit fee is 5%. The calculated amount will be 5% of 90. Which is 4.5. But the calculation should be 5% of 100. Which is 5.

So on each unvouch() the protocol will lose 0.5%. Which will increase if the difference between entry and exit fees are more.
### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When calculating exitFee factor in the previous fees as follows:
```solidity
exitFee = amount.muldiv(exitFeeBasisPoints,(BASIS_POINT_SCALE - entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints - entryDonationFeeBasisPoints - entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints), Math.Rounding.Ceil);
```
