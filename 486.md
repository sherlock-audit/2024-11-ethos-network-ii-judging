# Maximum total fees can exceed intended 10% in `EthosVouch.sol`

## Vulnerability Details

According to the contest readme:
> Are there any limitations on values set by admins (or other roles) in the codebase, including restrictions on array lengths?

> For both contracts:
  Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%

This is the [MAX_TOTAL_FEES](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120) constant defined as 10000 basis points (100%), which is meant to enforce the maximum total fees as 10%.
```js
  uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000; 
```
Whenever any fee is updated [checkFeeExceedsMaximum](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L996-L1004) function is called to to ensure the total doesn't exceed `MAX_TOTAL_FEES`.
```js
function checkFeeExceedsMaximum(uint256 currentFee, uint256 newFee) internal view {
    uint256 totalFees = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints +
      exitFeeBasisPoints +
      entryDonationFeeBasisPoints +
      entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints +
      newFee -
      currentFee;
    if (totalFees > MAX_TOTAL_FEES) revert FeesExceedMaximum(totalFees, MAX_TOTAL_FEES);
  }
```
However, the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` constant is incorrectly set to 10000 basis points (100%) instead of the intended 10% (1000 basis points). As a result, the system allows the cumulative fees to exceed the intended limit of 10%.

As this limit was highlighted in the readme itself, we consider __MEDIUM__ severity to be appropriate.

## Impact
Total fees can be configured as high as 100%, violating the intended limit of 10%

## Recommendation
```diff
-  uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;  
+  uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000; // 10%
```
