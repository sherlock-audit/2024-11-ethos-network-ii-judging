# Users will be able to IncreaseVouch even when ethosVouch is paused

### Summary

EthosVouch contract implements pausable functionality which according to sponsors would pause `when there's a risk of funds being lost due to compromise`. During that event all of the core functionalities like vouchByAddress , vouchByProfile ,unvouch , increaseVouch etc MUST BE PAUSED however the critical method `increaseVouch` is missing `whenNotPaused` modifer making it available for users to call and potentially engage with protocol through monetory transactions by increasing vouch when in-fact this action MUST NOT be allowed when the contract is paused.

This NOT a user error rather a security flaw in the implementation because if it was to be a user error , the `whenNotPaused` modifier should not be present on other functions too assuming the users are "intelligent enough" to monitor on-chain conditions all the time.


### Root Cause

Missing `whenNotPaused` modifier in ethosVouch.sol line #426
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Vouch must exist
2. Contract must be paused

### External pre-conditions

1. User wants to increase Vouch for already existing one

### Attack Path

1. User initiates some amount of ETH increase in Vouch

### Impact

The users might be interacting with the protocol at vulnerable condition ( for example a critical bug of funds loss is discovered ) and user will put their more funds into the protocol which will be endangered.

### PoC

The issue is evident from the detailed description above.

### Mitigation

Add `whenNotPaused` modifier on `increaseVouch` function too.
