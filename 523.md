# Market funds are inflated when buying votes

### Summary

Incorrect accounting in `buyVotes()` will lead to stuck funds or inflated amount being withdrawal when graduating market

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket:481](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481) users can votes are sold. The `marketFunds` mapping is updated to reflect this

```solidity
marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;

```

This is incorrect since `fundsPaid` include fees that does not belong to the market.

In  `calculateBuy()` it can be seen in [ReputationMarket:978](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L978)

```solidity
    fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;
```

that this is the case. 

When the market is graduated we attempt to withdrawal the funds [ReputationMarket:675](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L675)

```solidity
    _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]); 
```

Here we will either withdraw more than we should essentially stealing from other markets or we will revert if this is the final market or if the discrepancy accumulated is large enough
