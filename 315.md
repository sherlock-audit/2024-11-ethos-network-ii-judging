# Missing Slippage Check When Selling Votes Leads to Seller Receiving Fewer Funds Than Expected

## Description

**Context:**

Users sell their trust/distrust votes to the Reputation Market they bought from. The reason for selling their votes could be that they have gained profit from a price rise or want to limit the amount of loss they incur.

When users sell their votes, based on the number of votes they sell and the vote price, they receive funds in ETH.

**Vulnerability Details:**

The function responsible for allowing users to sell their votes in the `ReputationMarket` contract is called [sellVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L534). This function lacks a slippage check to ensure the seller does not receive less ETH than expected due to the delay between the seller's transaction being mined and other users' buy/sell transactions being processed at the same time.

## Impact

**Damage:** High

**Likelihood:** High

**Details:** The lack of a slippage check in `sellVotes()` function can lead to the seller receiving an unexpectedly low ETH amount when selling their votes.

## Proof of Concept

**Attack Path:**

1. Let's say hypothetically each vote costs `1 ETH`, and the seller holds `10 votes`.
2. The seller decides to sell all `10 votes`, calling the `sellVotes()` function, expecting to receive `10 ETH` in return.
3. Once the seller submits the transaction, other users buy/sell vote transactions get mined first, causing a significant change in vote prices.
4. Once the seller transaction is mined, he only receives `4 ETH`. an unexpected outcome that could have been prevented if a slippage protection mechanism had been implemented.


**POC:**

- Not needed

## Recommended Mitigation

Add a slippage protection mechanism similar to the one used in the `buyVotes()` function. In this slippage check, the user should specify the minimum amount of funds they expect to receive when selling their votes.
