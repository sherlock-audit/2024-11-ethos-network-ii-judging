# Update of unhealthyResponsePeriod Prevents Users from Marking Vouches as Unhealthy

### Summary





### Root Cause

The updateUnhealthyResponsePeriod function in the EthosVouch contract allows an admin to change the duration within which a vouch can be marked as unhealthy after unvouching. This change can be made immediately and without any transition period, potentially preventing users from marking a vouch as unhealthy if they are close to the current limit.

```solidity
function updateUnhealthyResponsePeriod(
    uint256 unhealthyResponsePeriodDuration
  ) external onlyAdmin whenNotPaused {
    unhealthyResponsePeriod = unhealthyResponsePeriodDuration;
  }
```
