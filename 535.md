# Malicious users or normal users with sufficient eth can cause denial-of-service through large vote buying griefing attack

### Summary

The unbounded loop in `ReputationMarket::_calculateBuy()` enables potential griefing attacks where an attacker with sufficient funds can cause excessive gas consumption and block congestion when vote prices are low, impacting other users' ability to interact with the protocol.

### Root Cause

`buyVotes()` in [ReputationMarket.sol:442](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442-L493) allows users to provide arbitrary amounts of ETH that get processed in _calculateBuy() through an unbounded while loop, if the price of either Trust or Distrust votes go low enough, a user with sufficient eth can cause denial-of-service.

```solidity
while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
    fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
    fundsPaid += votePrice;
    votesBought++;
    market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += 1;
    votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1.Trust or Distrust vote prices need to be low enough
 

### External pre-conditions

1. Access to sufficient ETH to trigger many iterations
   - Can be achieved with as much as 6-12 ETH when vote prices are low. Even 3 ETH is sufficient, when vote prices reach 0.001 ETH which is easily possible if the other side has seen much more demand. 

### Attack Path

1. Wait for Trust or Distrust vote prices to drop to as low 0.002 ETH per vote
2. Submit transaction with large ETH amount (e.g., 6 ETH) to `buyVotes()`
3. The unbounded loop will attempt to process thousands of iterations:
   - Each iteration: state update + price calculation
   - Example: 3000 iterations * (21000 base gas + ~5000 gas per operation)
4. Transaction will likely hit block gas limit and revert at around 3000+ votes
5. Can be repeated to continually block function access

### Impact

1. Denial of service through block gas limit exhaustion
   - Base L2 block gas limit: ~15M gas
   - Attack transactions approach/exceed this limit
2. Economic denial of service
   - Users must pay high gas fees to compete
   - Failed transactions waste gas
3. Market manipulation risk
   - Large pending transactions can affect market pricing
   - Failed transactions still impact gas prices
4. Protocol functionality degradation
   - Vote buying becomes unreliable
   - Market price discovery mechanisms disrupted

### PoC
The test fails from attempting to buy 6000 votes:

```typescript
it('should allow a user to buy unlimited positive votes', async () => {
    const amountToBuy = DEFAULT.buyAmount * 2000n;  //can fail at 3000n+

    const { trustVotes: positive, distrustVotes: negative } = await userA.buyVotes({
      buyAmount: amountToBuy,
    });
    expect(positive).to.equal(2007);
    expect(negative).to.equal(0);
  });
```

### Mitigation

- Implement maximum votes per transaction.

```solidity
function _calculateBuy(
    Market memory market,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 funds
) private view {
    uint256 constant MAX_VOTES_PER_TX = 1000;
    
    while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice && votesBought < MAX_VOTES_PER_TX) {
        // ... existing loop code ...
    }
}
```

- Implement batch buying with explicit limits.
- Add upper bound on input funds relative to current price.
