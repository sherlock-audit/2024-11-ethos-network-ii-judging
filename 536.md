# Incorrect `marketFunds` accounting will lead to loss of funds

### Summary

The [`ReputationMarket::marketFunds`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L112) mapping is used for accounting of funds per profileId.
It is first set as `initialLiquidityRequired` in the [`ReputationMarket::_createMarket`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L315)
```solidity
  function _createMarket(
    uint256 profileId,
    address recipient,
    uint256 marketConfigIndex
  ) private nonReentrant {
   /// . . . Rest of the code
    // Tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] = initialLiquidityRequired;
   /// . . . Rest of the code
  }
```
This accounting is increased in [`ReputationMarket::buyVotes`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442) and decreased in [`ReputationMarket::sellVotes`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495) respectively.
```solidity
  function buyVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 expectedVotes,
    uint256 slippageBasisPoints
  ) public payable whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
   /// . . . Rest of the code
    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
   /// . . . Rest of the code
  }
```
```solidity
  // Sell votes
  function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    /// . . . Rest of the code
    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
   /// . . . Rest of the code
  }
```
However, the issue is with the way the `fundsReceived` is calculated in [`ReputationMarket::buyVotes`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442) functionality where the [`_calculateBuy`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L942) at the very end re-adds `protocolFee` and `donationFee` ([`L978`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L978))
```solidity
    fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;
```
This discrepancy leads to `marketFunds` store a higher value than it should actually hold as `protocolFees` would have been already paid as well as in another scenario where there are enough funds due to multiple markets being live, the `donationEscrow` funds are not supposed to be touched by the `GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL` address but are being added above.
Hence, it would either lead to loss of funds where admin / `GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL` address will be denied withdrawing or users who created market will not be able to withdraw the received donations.


### Root Cause

In [`ReputationMarket.sol:L978`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L978), there is an improper accounting where `protocolFee` and `donation` are added to the `fundsPaid` variable
```solidity
    fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to set all fees (`>0`), ideally protocol fee basis points should be smaller than donation fee basis points for showcasing both kind of attack vectors.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

# Two attack paths:-
## First
1. A user creates a market using `createMarket`.
2. Some user decides to buy votes in this market and calls the `buyVotes` function
3. Admin (let's assume graduation contract as Admin for now) decides it's time to graduate the market and calls the `graduateMarket` function
4. Admin tries to withdraw the graduated funds using `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` but this would revert as the `marketFunds` had incorrectly added `protocolFee` in the `_calculateBuy` function, which has already being transferred to the `protocolFeeAddress`.

## Second
1. A user `A` creates a market using `createMarket` and a few people buy votes in that market using `buyVotes`.
2. Another user `B` creates a market using `createMarket` and again few people buy votes in that market using `buyVotes`.
3. Now the admin decides to graduate market A and market B using `graduateMarket` function, and decides to withdraw funds from them using `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds`. (`Assume that the donations received by both users were greater than the protocol fee`)
4.The user `A` and user `B` now try to withdraw donation funds using the `withdrawDonations` function, but this will revert as the admin withdrew graduated funds whose `marketFunds` had incorrectly added `donation` in the `_calculateBuy` function, hence the contract holds less ether than total donation accounted for.

### Impact

1. The graduation withdrawal contract / admin loses entire initial liquidity + any funds users have deposited whilst buying votes once market has been graduated 
2. The users will lose on the donations received as eth transfer would fail due to lack of funds.

### PoC

The test case below was added inside the `rep.fees.test.ts` file.
```solidity
    it('should not be able to graduate market', async () => {
      await deployer.contractAddressManager.contract
      .connect(deployer.OWNER)
      .updateContractAddressesForNames([deployer.ADMIN.address], ['GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL'])
      const protocolFeeBalanceBefore = await ethers.provider.getBalance(protocolFeeAddress);
      const contractBalanceBefore = await ethers.provider.getBalance(reputationMarket.target);
      await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints(entryFee);
      await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setDonationBasisPoints(donationFee);
      const { simulatedVotesBought, simulatedFundsPaid } = await userA.simulateBuy();
      const { trustVotes, fundsPaid } = await userA.buyVotes();
      const contractBalanceAfter = await ethers.provider.getBalance(reputationMarket.target);
      const contractFundsReceived = contractBalanceAfter - contractBalanceBefore;
      const protocolFeeBalanceAfter = await ethers.provider.getBalance(protocolFeeAddress);
      const protocolFeeReceived = protocolFeeBalanceAfter - protocolFeeBalanceBefore;
      console.log('contractFundsReceived', contractFundsReceived);
      console.log('protocolFeeReceived', protocolFeeReceived);
      console.log('fundsPaid', fundsPaid);
      console.log('simulatedFundsPaid', simulatedFundsPaid);
      console.log('trustVotes', trustVotes);
      console.log('simulatedVotesBought', simulatedVotesBought);
      console.log('protocolFeeBalanceBefore', protocolFeeBalanceBefore);
      console.log('protocolFeeBalanceAfter', protocolFeeBalanceAfter);

      expect(simulatedVotesBought).to.equal(
        trustVotes,
        'Simulated votes bought should equal trust votes',
      );
      expect(simulatedFundsPaid).to.be.equal(
        fundsPaid,
        'Simulated funds paid should be equal to actual funds paid',
      );
      expect(fundsPaid).to.equal(
        contractFundsReceived + protocolFeeReceived,
        'Actual funds paid should be equal to funds received by the contract and protocol fee',
      );
      // withdraw the donation
      // await userA.withdrawDonations();
      await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).graduateMarket(ethosUserA.profileId);
      await expect(reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(ethosUserA.profileId)).to.be.revertedWith('ETH transfer failed');
    });
```    

### Mitigation

It is recommended to not add `protocolFee` and `donation` in the `_calculateBuy` function
```diff
-     fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;
```
