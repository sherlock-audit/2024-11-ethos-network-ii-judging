# Lack of Storage gap leads to storage collision

### Summary

When creating upgradable contracts that inherit from other contracts is important that there are storage gap in case storage variable are added to inherited contracts. If an inherited contract is a stateless contract (i.e. it doesn't have any storage) then it is acceptable to omit a storage gap, since these function similar to libraries and aren't intended to add any storage.The lack of _gap in these contract could lead to storage collisions if another state variables are introduced.

### Impact

The imported Access Control can pose a significant risk when updating a contract because they can shift the storage slots of all inherited contracts.

### Mitigation

Add storage gaps to all inherited contracts that contain storage variables.
