# Users Can Avoid Some Fees in EthosVouch

### Summary

Users can split their purchases into several portions larger than `configuredMinimumVouchAmount`, call `vouchByProfileId`, and then call `increaseVouch` to avoid paying all the fees they would incur in `increaseVouch` due to being part of the `vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId` array.

### Root Cause

[EthosVouch.sol#L701](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L701)

By following the steps mentioned in the summary, the user is already part of `vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId]`, which would allow them to avoid part of the fees they are paying.
