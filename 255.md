# ReputationMarket::getVotePrice Fails to Provide Accurate Price for Vote Sales

### Summary

In the case of token sales, `ReputationMarket::_calculateSell` first reduces `market.votes` and then calculates the price:

```solidity
market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;  
votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);  
fundsReceived += votePrice;  
votesSold++;  
```

However, in `ReputationMarket::getVotePrice`, this adjustment **does not occur for sales**.
