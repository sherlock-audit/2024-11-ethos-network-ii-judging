# Corruptible Upgradeability Pattern in `EthosVouch.sol` and `ReputationMarket.sol`

## Vulnerability Details

Following is the inheritance chain of the Ethos Contracts:

**EthosVouch Inheritance Chain:**
```js
EthosVouch
├── AccessControl
│   ├── IPausable
│   ├── PausableUpgradeable
│   ├── AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable
│   └── SignatureControl
├── UUPSUpgradeable
├── ITargetStatus (interface)
└── ReentrancyGuard
```
**ReputationMarket Inheritance Chain:**
```js
ReputationMarket
├── AccessControl
│   ├── IPausable
│   ├── PausableUpgradeable
│   ├── AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable
│   └── SignatureControl
├── UUPSUpgradeable
└── ReentrancyGuard
```
[EthosVouch.sol#L67](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L67)
[ReputationMarket.sol#L36](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L36)
The `EthosVouch.sol` and `ReputationMarket.sol` contract inherits from `ReentrancyGuard` instead of `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable`, which is necessary for compatibility with upgradeable proxy systems. `ReentrancyGuard` is not designed to support the `initializer` function or the upgradeable-compatible storage layout required by UUPS proxies.

The non-upgradeable `ReentrancyGuard` uses a storage slot that could potentially collide with other storage variables in future upgrades. This is because `ReentrancyGuard` initializes its storage in the constructor, while upgradeable contracts need to initialize storage in the initialize function.

Also `SignatureControl` and `AccessControl` though out-of-scope for this audit do not define gap slots. This can result in misbehaviour in future when variables are added.

In upgradeable contracts, maintaining a consistent storage layout is critical to prevent issues during upgrades, as each contract upgrade relies on an unchanged storage structure to function correctly. The current implementation of `ReentrancyGuard` and missing `strorage gaps` does not adhere to the requirements for upgradeable contracts and can lead to storage clashes during upgrades.


## Impact
The storage layout of Ethos contracts may be corrupted after upgrading the contracts and causing misbehaviour in the system

## Recommendation
1. Changing the inheritance to use the upgradeable version:
```js
contract EthosVouch is AccessControl, UUPSUpgradeable, ITargetStatus, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable {
```
```js
contract ReputationMarket is AccessControl, UUPSUpgradeable, ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable {
```
2. Add initialization in the `initialize` function:
```js
__ReentrancyGuard_init();
```
3. Add `uint256[50] __gap;` inside `AccessControl` and `SignatureControl` to enable adding future variables.
