# Update the `marketFunds[ ]` mapping with wrong values

### Summary

The values in side `marketFunds[profileId]` are not correct 

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket.sol#buyVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481) function increase the tally market funds `marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;`
 However, taking a back step it will show how is the `fundsPaid` value calculated
From [_calculateBuy()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L972-L978) logic the value of `fundsPaid` comes from three parts:
1- `fundsPaid += votePrice;` is the total price of the votes
2- `protocolFee`
3- `donation`

the `protocolFee` will leave the contract immediately (check `applyFees()`) and `donation` is saved in `donationEscrow[ ]` mapping with it could get withdraw at any time using `withdrawDonations()` 

So, both parts 2 and 3 are out, only 1 is still in the contract.
the `marketFunds[]` values will be used after withdrawing funds from a graduated market, which will transfer the wrong value to the authorized graduation withdrawal address (the excited amount could be from the user's donations)

### Attack Path

1- Every time the user calls `buyVotes()` the value of `marketFunds[]` will increased more than it should 
2- At some point, the `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()` will withdraw all funds from a graduated market

### Impact

- The `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()` will withdraw more funds than it should from the `ReputationMarket.sol` contract this will leave the contract in deficit 
- The graduated markets Process will not be possible (in case of the last market) due to insufficient funds in this contract 

### Mitigation

Update this line from `buyVotes()`
```diff
- marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
+ marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation
```
