# User might accidentally create a different config if one of them is removed.

### Summary
When creating a config, all the user has to input is the id of the config they want to use 

```solidity
  function createMarketWithConfig(uint256 marketConfigIndex) public payable whenNotPaused {
    uint256 senderProfileId = _getProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);

    // Verify sender can create market
    if (enforceCreationAllowList && !creationAllowedProfileIds[senderProfileId]) {
      revert MarketCreationUnauthorized(
        MarketCreationErrorCode.PROFILE_NOT_AUTHORIZED,
        msg.sender,
        senderProfileId
      );
    }
    _createMarket(senderProfileId, msg.sender, marketConfigIndex);
  }
```

The problem is that the config ids are subject to change, for example due to one of them getting removed. This unexpected change could result in the user creating a different market than the one expected. As profiles can only create 1 market in their lifetime, this makes it an even bigger impact.

### Root Cause
Market's ids can change


### Attack Path
1. There are currently three markets (ids are 0, 1 and 2) 
2.  User wants to create a market with the config of the 2nd one. So they call create market with id 1.
3. In the meantime, admins remove config with id 0.
4. Because of this, the actual market which would be created would be different than the one initially wanted.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L272

### Impact
Creating a different market than intended.

### Mitigation
Upon deleting a market, do not shift the other ones.
