# User can create a market with wrong configuration, because of Admin unintentionally altered market configurations

### Summary

The race condition between the admin's removal of a market configuration and a user's attempt to create a market will cause a misconfiguration for the user as the admin will remove the intended configuration before the user's transaction is processed.

### Root Cause

In `ReputationMarket.sol`, the issue arises from the lack of transaction ordering guarantees when multiple transactions are sent to the Base L2, batched, and then sent to the Ethereum network. Specifically:
- The admin can call `removeMarketConfig(index x)` while a user is calling `createMarketWithConfig(index x)`. If the admin's transaction is processed first, the configuration at index x will be removed before the user's transaction can create the market.
- The `createMarketWithConfig()` function relies on the `marketConfigIndex` parameter to access the `marketConfigs` array. If the index provided by the user corresponds to a configuration that has just been removed, it will lead to unexpected behavior. 

Base L2 uses a technology called Optimistic Rollups. Transactions are collected off-chain, bundled together, and then submitted to Ethereum in batches. When the two transactions (admin's  `removeMarketConfig(index x)` and user's `createMarketWithConfig(index x)`) are bundled together and admin's transaction is executed first, the user can create a market with wrong configs.

### Internal pre-conditions

_These indexes are used for simplicity, it could be with any indexes._ 

1. Two more market configs are created via `addMarketConfig()`.
2. On index 3 in the array `marketConfigs[3]` we have initial liquidity 1 ether, initial votes 100_000 and base price 0.01 ether.
3. On index 4 in the array `marketConfigs[4]` we have initial liquidity 0.01 ether, initial votes 1 and base price 0.01 ether.

### External pre-conditions

1. Admin calls the function `removeMarketConfig(3)`
2. In the same moment, or somewhere around it, a user calls 1 ether and calls the function `createMarketWithConfig(3)`
3. The two transactions are bundled together, and sent to the Ethereum network for execution
4. Admin's transaction is executed before the user's transaction

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

_Continuing the example from the Internal and External pre-conditions:_

Once admin's transaction is executed, the array `marketConfigs` at index 3 is deleted, and replaced with the one on index 4, so now `marketConfigs[3]` would have such configurations: `initialLiquidity` = 0.01 ether, `initialVotes` = 1, `basePrice` = 0.01 ether. 

Then the user's transaction is executed and he creates a market with wrong configurations. The user would get their 0.99 ether back, however, they thought that they are creating a market of a more premium tier, but they have created the most basic tier market. They are unable to reverse this, and they would have to wait for the market to be eventually graduated and lose a lot of time and the user is left with a market that does not meet their expectations, nor they agreed on it.

The user is unable to create a new market of a more premium tier, because one user is allowed to have only one market at a time because of this check: [Github Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L321-L322)

```solidity
if (markets[profileId].votes[TRUST] != 0 || markets[profileId].votes[DISTRUST] != 0) {
      revert MarketAlreadyExists(profileId);
    }
```

Neither the admin, nor the user did anything out of the line, however, the user is at disadvantage.
