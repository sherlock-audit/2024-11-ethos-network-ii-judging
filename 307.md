# Compromised Addresses Can Still interect with the protocol .

### Summary

The `vouchByProfileId` function in EthosVouch contract lacks validation to prevent compromised addresses from creating vouches. While the contract integrates with EthosProfile for address verification, it doesn't check if the vouching address has been marked as compromised, potentially allowing malicious actors to continue vouching using compromised addresses.

### Root Cause

The `vouchByProfileId` function only verifies that the sender has a valid profile through `verifiedProfileIdForAddress()` but doesn't check if the address is compromised:

```solidity:contracts/EthosVouch.sol
function vouchByProfileId(
uint256 subjectProfileId,
string calldata comment,
string calldata metadata
) public payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
// validate author profile
uint256 authorProfileId = IEthosProfile(
contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender); // Only checks if profile exists and is not archived

// Missing check: should verify address is not compromised
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Contract must be unpaused
2. Sender must have a valid profile ID
3. Subject profile must exist and not be archived
4. Vouch amount must meet minimum requirements


### External pre-conditions

1. Attacker has access to a compromised address
2. Compromised address has an associated profile
3. Profile is not archived
4. Attacker has sufficient ETH to create vouch

### Attack Path

1. Attacker gains access to a compromised address that has a valid profile
2. Original owner marks address as compromised in EthosProfile
3. Despite being compromised, attacker can still:
```solidity
// Attacker calls with compromised address
ethosVouch.vouchByProfileId{value: minimumVouchAmount}(
targetProfileId,
"Malicious vouch",
""
);
```
4. Vouch is successfully created despite address being compromised


### Impact

- Compromised addresses can continue to create vouches
- Undermines the address compromise protection mechanism
- Allows malicious actors to maintain influence through vouches
- Threre is also a limit to maximum vouches . That gets reduced for a profileID 



### Mitigation


1. **Add Compromised Address Check:**
```solidity:contracts/EthosVouch.sol
function vouchByProfileId(
uint256 subjectProfileId,
string calldata comment,
string calldata metadata
) public payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
IEthosProfile profile = IEthosProfile(
contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
);

// Check if address is compromised
if (profile.isAddressCompromised(msg.sender)) {
revert AddressCompromised(msg.sender);
}

uint256 authorProfileId = profile.verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);
// ... rest of the function
}
```

2. **Add Modifier:**
```solidity
modifier onlyNonCompromisedAddress() {
if (IEthosProfile(contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE))
.isAddressCompromised(msg.sender)) {
revert AddressCompromised(msg.sender);
}
_;
}
```

3. **Apply to All Relevant Functions:**
```solidity
function vouchByProfileId(...) public payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant onlyNonCompromisedAddress {
// ... existing implementation
}

function vouchByAddress(...) public payable onlyNonZeroAddress(subjectAddress) whenNotPaused onlyNonCompromisedAddress {
// ... existing implementation
}
```
