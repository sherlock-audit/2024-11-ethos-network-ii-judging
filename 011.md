# `isParticipant()` returns incorrect `true` for users who sold all their votes

### Summary

The [`sellVotes()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495) function does not update the `isParticipant` mapping after a participant sells all their votes. Consequently, the `isParticipant()` function incorrectly returns `true` for users who have exited the reputation market, leading to inaccurate participant tracking.

### Root Cause

The `isParticipant` mapping is used to determine if a user is an active participant in the reputation market. The [`ReputationMarket#L120`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L120) states "Use isParticipant to check if they've sold all their votes".

```solidity
  // append only; don't bother removing. **Use isParticipant to check if they've sold all their votes.**
  mapping(uint256 => address[]) public participants;
  // profileId => participant => isParticipant
  mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => bool)) public isParticipant;
```

However, since [`sellVotes()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495) does not update this mapping when a participant sells all their votes, users remain marked as participants even after exiting the market.
