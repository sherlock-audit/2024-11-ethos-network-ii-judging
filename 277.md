# Donation Recipient Can Earn Donation Fees From a Reputation Market They Are No Longer Associated With


## Description

**Context:**

To understand this report, itâ€™s essential to first understand how the `EthosProfile` contract works. (Note: In the current contest, this contract is out of scope, but its root cause and impact apply to the Reputation Market.)

1. A user without a profile on the Ethos Protocol must be invited by another user with a valid Ethos profile. This is achieved by the inviting user calling the [EthosProfile::inviteAddress()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L183-L214) function.
2. Once invited, the user can call the [EthosProfile::createProfile()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L159-L175) function to create their profile in the Ethos Network.
3. A user with a valid Ethos profile can register other users under their profile by calling the [EthosProfile::registerAddress()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L352-L389) function. This allows a single profile to have multiple associated users.
4. If a user loses trust or no longer wants another user to be associated with their profile, they can unregister and delete that user from the profile, by calling the [EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L404-L430) function.

Also Each profile has a unique ID that can be queried to identify the Profile.

**Vulnerability details:**

Imagine a profile with two users, `User1` and `User2`. `User1` has registered `User2` to his profile (let's say the profile ID is `10`).

then `User2` creates a Reputation Market by calling the [createMarketWithConfig()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L281-L293) function, becoming the donation recipient. This means `User2` receives donation fees whenever users buy votes from the market.

Later on, `User1` loses trust in `User2` for whatever reason and unregisters him from the profile by calling `EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex()` function. However, `User2` remains the donation recipient for the Reputation Market they created earlier and continues to earn fees. This is not how it should work, as `User2` is no longer associated with profile ID `10` (Repuation Markets Are Identified By Profile Id).

The `ReputationMarket` contract should include a function to update the donation recipient when a user who is getting unregistered from a profile, is the current donation recipient of the market. This ensures that an unregistered user does not continue receiving fees from a Reputation Market they are no longer associated with.

## Impact
 
**Damage:** High

**Likelihood:** High

**Details:** If a user who is the donation recipient of a Reputation Market gets unregistered, they will continue to receive fees. The actual profile representatives, who own the market, which is identified by the profile ID, will receive nothing when users buy votes from their market.

## Proof of Concept

**Attack Path:**

1. A profile has two users, `Bob` and `Alice`. The profile ID associated with this profile is `10`.
2. `Alice` creates a Reputation Market by calling the `createMarketWithConfig()` function, becoming the donation recipient for the market. As result, whoever buys votes from this market, fees will be transferred to `Alice`.
3. `Bob` loses trust in `Alice` for whatever reason and unregisters her from his profile by calling the `EthosProfile::deleteAddressAtIndex()` function.
4. Alice remains the donation recipient for the market that is associated with profile ID `10`, continuing to earn fees. while Bob, the primary user representing the market and profile, receives nothing.

**POC:**

- If needed, I am happy to provide one upon judge request.

## Recommended Mitigation

As outlined above, a function should be added to the `ReputationMarket` contract that can only be called by the `EthosProfile` contract whenever a user unregisters another user. The function should:

1. Check if a Reputation Market exists for the user's profile.
2. If it exists, verify whether the unregistered user is the current donation recipient of the market. If so, set one of the remaining users of the profile as the new donation recipient, since a profile can have more than one user associated with it. Also, transfer any accrued donation fees from the unregistered user to the new user who will be set as the new donation recipient.
3. If no Reputation Market exists for user profile, do nothing.
