# The protocol fee should be deducted from `marketFunds` in the `sellVotes` function.

### Summary

In `ReputationMarket.sol:522`, the protocol fee is not deducted from `marketFunds` in the `sellVotes` function, causing the `marketFunds` to be greater than it should be. This may cause the transaction to revert or loss of funds when withdrawing funds from the graduated market.

In `ReputationMarket.sol:1041`, the `protocolFee` is calculated based on `fundsReceived`, which is the total price of selling votes and is a part of marketFunds. Notice that the returned `fundsReceived` does not include the `protocolFee`.
```solidity
// function: ReputationMarket.sol:_calculateSell()

        while (votesSold < amount) {
          if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
            revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
          }
    
          market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
          votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
          fundsReceived += votePrice;
          votesSold++;
        }
1041:   (fundsReceived, protocolFee, ) = previewFees(fundsReceived, false);
        minPrice = votePrice;

        return (votesSold, fundsReceived, votePrice, protocolFee, minPrice, maxPrice);
```

Then, the `protocolFee` is transferred to the protocol fee address (in `ReputationMarket.sol:517`), and the `fundsReceived` is transferred to the seller (in `ReputationMarket.sol:520`). Both the `protocolFee` and `fundsReceived` come from the `marketFunds` balance obtained during the buying of votes. However, in `ReputationMarket.sol:522`, only `fundsReceived` is deducted from `marketFunds`, while the `protocolFee` is not deducted. This results in the new `marketFunds` balance being greater than it should be.
```solidity
// function: ReputationMarket.sol:sellVotes()

        // calculate the amount of votes to sell and the funds received
        (
          uint256 votesSold,
          uint256 fundsReceived,
          ,
          uint256 protocolFee,
          uint256 minVotePrice,
          uint256 maxVotePrice
510:    ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);
    
        // update the market state
        markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
        votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
    
        // apply protocol fees
517:    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);
    
        // send the proceeds to the seller
520:    _sendEth(fundsReceived);
        // tally market funds
522:    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
```

When the market graduates and funds are withdrawn, since the balance of `marketFunds` is greater than it should be, more funds than actual will be transferred to the `GraduateContract`. The `_sendEth` operation in `ReputationMarket.sol:675` may be reverted due to insufficient balance, or if the balance is sufficient, the protocol will lose funds.
```solidity
// function: ReputationMarket.sol:withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()

675:    _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]);  
```

### Root Cause

In [`ReputationMarket.sol:522`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L522), the protocol fee is not deducted from `marketFunds` in the `sellVotes` function.

### Attack Path

1. A market is created.
2. Alice buys votes for the market.
3. Alice sell her votes for the market. 
4. GraduateContract graduates the market.
5. GraduateContract withdraws funds from the market, and the withdrawal reverts.

### Mitigation


```solidity
// function: ReputationMarket.sol:sellVotes()

    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived + protocolFee;
```
