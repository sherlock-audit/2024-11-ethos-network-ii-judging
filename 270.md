# Market owners can purchase votes for their own markets

### Summary

In the  `ReputationMarket`  , users are expected to be able to buy votes for any market. However, there is no verification to ensure that the buyer isn't the owner of the market. As a result, market owners can manipulate the price of votes for their own markets at will.
```solidity
  function buyVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 expectedVotes,
    uint256 slippageBasisPoints
  ) public payable whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // Determine how many votes can be bought with the funds provided
    (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);

    _checkSlippageLimit(votesBought, expectedVotes, slippageBasisPoints);

    // Apply fees first
    applyFees(protocolFee, donation, profileId);

    // Update market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += votesBought;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += votesBought;

    // Add buyer to participants if not already a participant
    if (!isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender]) {
      participants[profileId].push(msg.sender);
      isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = true;
    }

    // Calculate and refund remaining funds
    uint256 refund = msg.value - fundsPaid;
    if (refund > 0) _sendEth(refund);

    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
    emit VotesBought(
      profileId,
      msg.sender,
      isPositive,
      votesBought,
      fundsPaid,
      block.timestamp,
      minVotePrice,
      maxVotePrice
    );
    _emitMarketUpdate(profileId);
  }
```

### Root Cause

 Lack of access control.


### Affected Code

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442-L494

### Impact

Vote prices can be influenced by market owners rather than by market demand.

### Mitigation

Add access control.
```solidity
  if (profileId == _getProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender)) {
    revert("....     ......");
  }
```
