# MAX_TOTAL_FEES for `EthosVouch.sol` is set to `100%` instead of the expected `10%`

## Description
MAX_TOTAL_FEES [is set to 100%](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120) inside `EthosVouch.sol`. However the audit page clearly states that:
> For both contracts:
>   - Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%

## Impact
Function [checkFeeExceedsMaximum()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L996) which is internally called each time any fee value is changed, will allow the total fees to reach 100%:
```js
  File: ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol

   991:            /* @notice Checks if the new fee would cause the total fees to exceed the maximum allowed
   992:             * @dev This function is called before updating any fee to ensure the total doesn't exceed MAX_TOTAL_FEES
   993:             * @param currentFee The current value of the fee being updated
   994:             * @param newFee The proposed new value for the fee
   995:             */
   996:            function checkFeeExceedsMaximum(uint256 currentFee, uint256 newFee) internal view {
   997:              uint256 totalFees = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints +
   998:                exitFeeBasisPoints +
   999:                entryDonationFeeBasisPoints +
   1000:                entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints +
   1001:                newFee -
   1002:                currentFee;
   1003:@--->         if (totalFees > MAX_TOTAL_FEES) revert FeesExceedMaximum(totalFees, MAX_TOTAL_FEES);
   1004:            }
```

## Mitigation 
```diff
  File: ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol

-   120:            uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
+   120:            uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000;
```
