# Compromised Addresses Lock Staked Funds Indefinitely

### Summary

A vulnerability in the `EthosVouch` contract exposes users to permanent financial loss. The `unvouch` function requires the caller's address `(msg.sender)` to match the address that created the `vouch (authorAddress)`. If a user's vouching address is compromised, they cannot recover their staked funds using a different, secure address. This restriction within the `unvouch` function creates a situation where compromised addresses permanently trap staked funds.

### Root Cause

The `unvouch` function in the `EthosVouch.sol` contract enforces a condition where `msg.sender` (the address calling the function) must be equal to `vouches[vouchId].authorAddress `(the address that created the vouch). This check prevents users from calling `unvouch` with a different address, even if their original vouching address is compromised.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User Creates Vouch: A user creates a vouch using an address, denoted as address A.
2. Address Compromise: Later, address A becomes compromised and is flagged as such within the 'Ethos.profile' contract.
3. Attempted Recovery: The user, no longer in control of address A, tries to call the unvouch function using a new, secure address.
4. Function Reverts: Due to the msg.sender check, the unvouch function reverts, preventing the user from recovering their staked funds.
5. Funds Locked: The user's staked funds remain permanently locked within the protocol, irretrievable due to the compromised vouching address.

### Impact

This vulnerability exposes users to the permanent loss of staked funds. If a user's vouching address is compromised, they have no way to recover their staked assets through the `unvouch` function using a different address.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow users to withdraw vouches from addresses associated with the same profile ID, not just the original vouching address.
