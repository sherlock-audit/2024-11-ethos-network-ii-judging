# Fee Mismanagement in the `ReputationMarket.sellVotes` Function

### Summary

In the `ReputationMarket` contract, the `sellVotes` function currently subtracts `fundsReceived`, which inadvertently includes protocol exit fee from `marketFunds`. This results in the protocol fee being transferred twice in the `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` function, leading to a potential loss of funds for the protocol.

### Root Cause

The issue originates in the `_calculateSell` function, where `fundsReceived` does not contain the `protocolFee`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/tree/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L978

```solidity
    (fundsReceived, protocolFee, ) = previewFees(fundsReceived, false);
```

In the `sellVotes` function, the protocol exit fee is transferred to the `protocolFeeAddress` and the `fundsReceived` is then subtracted from `marketFunds[profileId]`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/tree/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L517-L522

```solidity
@>  applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

    // send the proceeds to the seller
    _sendEth(fundsReceived);
    // tally market funds
@>  marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
```

In the `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` function, the entire amount in `marketFunds[profileId]` is sent to the authorized graduation withdrawal address:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/tree/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L675

```solidity
  function withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(uint256 profileId) public whenNotPaused {
    address authorizedAddress = contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(
      "GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL"
    );
    if (msg.sender != authorizedAddress) {
      revert UnauthorizedWithdrawal();
    }
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);
    if (!graduatedMarkets[profileId]) {
      revert MarketNotGraduated();
    }
    if (marketFunds[profileId] == 0) {
      revert InsufficientFunds();
    }

@>  _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]);
    emit MarketFundsWithdrawn(profileId, msg.sender, marketFunds[profileId]);
    marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
  }
```

This process inadvertently attempts to transfer the fee amounts as well, leading to the double counting of fees.
