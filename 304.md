# Cumulative `calcFee` Precision Loss in `EthosVouch::applyFees()`

### Summary

in [EthosVouch:calcFee()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L975)
```solidity
  function calcFee(uint256 total, uint256 feeBasisPoints) internal pure returns (uint256 fee) {
    /*
     * Formula derivation:
     * 1. total = deposit + fee
     * 2. fee = deposit * (feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 3. total = deposit + deposit * (feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 4. total = deposit * (1 + feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 5. deposit = total / (1 + feeBasisPoints/10000)
     * 6. fee = total - deposit
     * 7. fee = total - (total * 10000 / (10000 + feeBasisPoints))
     */
    return
      total -
      (total.mulDiv(BASIS_POINT_SCALE, (BASIS_POINT_SCALE + feeBasisPoints), Math.Rounding.Floor));
  }

>In America, we add tax to everything. However we are stupid and add the tax ON TOP of the bill. So if your bill is $100, and there's 8% tax, your final bill is $108
Ethos wants to be just as "clever" 
The intent is that when we display to users: "would you like to vouch 100 Eth? Send us 107 Eth. It is 107 Eth because we have fees that add on another 7%"

This is the wording from sponsor on how the fees are intended to be calculated meaning that the total = 107 eth, deposit = 100 eth and fees = 7 eth 
satisfying the formula `total = deposit + fee`
107eth - ((107eth * 10_000)/(10_000 + 700)) = 7eth (fees).

The issue is this formula assume the percentage fees is counted at once (fees add to 7%) and then calculated with the formula, but due to the different fees paid, this percentage is broken into 3 (on entry) and calculated separately causing the total in fees to exceed 7% and charging the user more for deposit (and not making the user deposit round)

Note: The 7% used here was the same mentioned in the sponsor comments, fees in the contract tests on entry adds up to 4% but the same principles apply


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L975

`EthosVouch::calcFee()` assumes the fees are are calculated at once but 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L936-L938
in `EthosVouch::applyFees()`, the fees are calculated individually 
```solidity
uint256 protocolFee = calcFee(amount, entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints);
uint256 donationFee = calcFee(amount, entryDonationFeeBasisPoints);
uint256 vouchersPoolFee = calcFee(amount, entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints);
```
Example : using the current logic and formula `total -
      (total.mulDiv(10_000, (10_000 + feeBasisPoints), Math.Rounding.Floor));`  
and intended values of total = 104 eth, deposit = 100 eth and fees = 4 eth (for 4%)
```solidity
104e18 - ((104e18 * 10_000)/(10_000 + 50)) //entry fee 0.5%
= 517412935323385860 (0.5174129353233858 eth)

104e18 - ((104e18 * 10_000)/(10_000 + 150)) // donation fee 1.5%
= 1536945812807893000 (1.536945812807893 eth)

104e18 - ((104e18 * 10_000)/(10_000 + 200)) // voucher pool fee 2%
= 2039215686274515000 (2.039215686274515 eth)

517412935323385860 + 1536945812807893000 + 2039215686274515000
= 4093574434405794000

4093574434405794000/1e18
= 4.093574434405793 eth // is taken as fees which is not equal to the intended 4%
```
This leaves the user deposit as `total - fees`
= 99.9064255655942 eth

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User calls vouchByProfileId with valid subjectId and amount to vouch, but due to the precision loss in the calculation of fees, applyFees apply more fees than it should.

### Impact

- Users are been overcharged on the amount of fees cause due to the precision of the fee calculation, their deposit is going to be less than the expected (can also reduce users trust in protocol and it reputation) .
- This precision loss is present in every vouch and increase vouch, with more users vouching and increasing their vouch, the more they lose more to fees.
- The protocol ends up with discrepancies in its fee collection and distribution, resulting in financial inaccuracies.

### PoC

POC (proof of calculation) presented in the Root Cause

### Mitigation

When calculating fees with the formula `total -
      (total.mulDiv(10_000, (10_000 + feeBasisPoints), Math.Rounding.Floor));`
which is `total - ((total * 10_000)/(10_000 + feeBasisPoints)) `, the individual fees should be added together and then calculated once and should then be separated and distributed.
```solidity 
//intended values of total = 104 eth, deposit = 100 eth and fees = 4 eth (for 4%)
totalFees = entry fee + donation fee + voucher pool fee // => 0.5 + 1.5 + 2 = 4% (in BP 400)

104e18 - ((104e18 * 10_000)/(10_000 + totalFees)) //total fee 4%
= 4000000000000000000 (4 eth) //correct total fees

(4 eth * 50)/totalFees // entry fee 0.5%
= 0.5 eth

(4 eth * 150)/totalFees // donation fee 1.5%
= 1.5 eth

(4 eth * 200)/totalFees // voucher pool fee 2%
= 2 eth

```
The new calculation meet the intended values
