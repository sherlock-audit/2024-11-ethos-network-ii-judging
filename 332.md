# No lock funds after unvouch will allow the author to withdraw his funds before slash

### Summary

As stated in the [documentation](https://whitepaper.ethos.network/ethos-mechanisms/slash) the slash procedure will be done by voting.
>The whistleblower requests human validation by pledging a nominal reward to validators. Validators vote to indicate if they found the claims valid. Validators are rewarded the same whichever way they vote. 
If validators vote in favor of the whistleblower, they reward the whistleblower pledged to validators is reimbursed from the amount staked by the accused. This is the "slashing punishment," and it cannot exceed 10% of the total amount staked in Ethos.

The following proposal is also important.
>Any Ethos participant may act as a “whistleblower” to accuse another participant of inaccurate claims or unethical behavior. This accusation triggers a 24h lock on staking (and withdrawals) for the accused. 

As we can see, locking facilities for the accused is implied.

However, in the current implementation of the protocol, the [`unvouch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L452) function allows authors to withdraw funds immediately

```solidity
function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
    _vouchShouldExist(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);
    // because it's $$$, you can only withdraw/unvouch to the same address you used to vouch
    // however, we don't care about the status of the address's profile; funds are always attached
    // to an address, not a profile
    if (vouches[vouchId].authorAddress != msg.sender) {
      revert AddressNotVouchAuthor(vouchId, msg.sender, vouches[vouchId].authorAddress);
    }

    v.archived = true;
    // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
    v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt = block.timestamp;
    // remove the vouch from the tracking arrays and index mappings
    _removeVouchFromArrays(v);

    // apply fees and determine how much is left to send back to the author
    (uint256 toWithdraw, ) = applyFees(v.balance, false, v.subjectProfileId);
    // set the balance to 0 and save back to storage
    v.balance = 0;
    // send the funds to the author
    // note: it sends it to the same address that vouched; not the one that called unvouch
    (bool success, ) = payable(v.authorAddress).call{ value: toWithdraw }("");
    if (!success) {
      revert FeeTransferFailed("Failed to send ETH to author");
    }

    emit Unvouched(v.vouchId, v.authorProfileId, v.subjectProfileId);
  }
```

That way, the so-called defendants, when they find out their vouch has been subject to a vote can simply withdraw money from their vouch and create a new one that is not subject to a vote in a single transaction

### Root Cause

No lock of funds for voting period in case of withdraw 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

User sees that his vouch is on the ballot.
He simply withdraws funds from all his vouchs and uses them back in the same transaction, creating new vouchs.

### Impact

Completely breaks the logic of slash

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add funds lock after unvouch (for example for 24 hours)
