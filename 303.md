# Missing fee limit checks in `EthosVouch::initialize` allows "Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%" invariant to be broken

### Summary

Fee values are not checked when initializing the contract, which leads to the _"Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%"_ from the README being able to be broken.

### Root Cause

In [`EthosVouch::initialize()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L259), fees are not checked against the expected maximum values. From [Ethos' Sherlock page](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/675), _"Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%"_. However, the `initialize` function lacks such checks, which allows for the max fees invariant to be broken.



### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

The contract is initialized, potentially leading to the invariant of fees exceeding 10% being broken.

### Impact

Medium, given that an invariant explicitly mentioned in the README can be effectively broken.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Considering adding the corresponding checks for fees when initializing `EthosVouch`.
