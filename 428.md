# The `EthosVouch.increaseVouch()` function should only be callable by the vouch creator.

### Summary

The current design allows holders of the same `profileId` to increase a vouch created by other holders with the same `profileId`.

However, only the vouch creator can unvouch, and the vouch creator retains all unvouched funds.

This mechanism poses a potential risk of fund loss for those who increase the vouch.

### Root Cause

As shown in the [increaseVouch()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L24-L26) function, holders of the same `profileId` can increase a vouch created by other holders with the same `profileId`.

```solidity
      function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable nonReentrant {
        // vouch increases much also meet the minimum vouch amount
        if (msg.value < configuredMinimumVouchAmount) {
          revert MinimumVouchAmount(configuredMinimumVouchAmount);
        }
        // get the profile id of the author
24:     uint256 profileId = IEthosProfile(
25:       contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
26:     ).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);
        _vouchShouldBelongToAuthor(vouchId, profileId);
        // make sure this vouch is active; not unvouched
        _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);
    
        uint256 subjectProfileId = vouches[vouchId].subjectProfileId;
        (uint256 toDeposit, ) = applyFees(msg.value, true, subjectProfileId);
        vouches[vouchId].balance += toDeposit;
    
        emit VouchIncreased(vouchId, profileId, subjectProfileId, msg.value);
      }
```

However, the [unvouch()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L459) function is only callable by the vouch creator, and all funds are sent to the vouch creator.

```solidity
       function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
         ...

459:     if (vouches[vouchId].authorAddress != msg.sender) {
460:       revert AddressNotVouchAuthor(vouchId, msg.sender, vouches[vouchId].authorAddress);
461:     }
     
         ...

475:     (bool success, ) = payable(v.authorAddress).call{ value: toWithdraw }("");
         
         ...
       }
```
