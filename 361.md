# An attacker can inflate `marketFunds` by buying votes, leading to unauthorized withdrawal.

### Summary

Incorrect accounting in `buyVotes` will cause unauthorized withdrawal of ETH for the protocol as an attacker will buy votes and inflate `marketFunds[profileId]` by including protocol fees and donations in the balance.

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket.buyVotes: 481](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481), the `marketFunds[profileId]` is incorrectly increased in `buyVotes` by `fundsPaid`, which includes protocol fees and donations, overstating the market funds.

### Internal pre-conditions

> Protocol entry fees and/or donations are set to non-zero values.
> An active market exists for a specific profileId.
> The attacker has sufficient ETH to buy votes.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `buyVotes` with sufficient funds.
2. The `buyVotes` function adds `fundsPaid` (including protocol fees and donations) to `marketFunds[profileId]`.
3. Repeating this action inflates `marketFunds[profileId]` artificially.
4. Upon market graduation, the inflated `marketFunds` allows excess ETH to be withdrawn.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss of funds as excess ETH is withdrawn from the contract, potentially affecting other markets and participants.

### PoC

In `buyVotes`, adjust `marketFunds` to include only the net amount added to the market:

```solidity
uint256 netFundsAdded = fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation;
marketFunds[profileId] += netFundsAdded;
```
