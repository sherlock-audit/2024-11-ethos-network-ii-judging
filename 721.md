### Summary

This issue is seen in both ```buyVotes``` and  ```sellVotes``` once it updates the ```market.votes``` inside ```_calculateBuy``` then it updates it again in ```_calculateBuy```

Basically we update it once inside ```_calculateBuy``` by getting exact ```market``` by getting the exact profileId  by calling the ```_calculateBuy``` inside the ```buyVotes``` and ```sellVotes``` functions 

```solidity
(
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);
```

and when we update the ```market``` inside ```_calculateBuy```

We re-Update it in both ```buyVotes``` and ```sellVotes```

```solidity
markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += votesBought;
```

causes re Updating  and x2 of the actual amount of ```votesBought``` or ```votesSold```

markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += votesBought;
```

### Mitigation

Update it just once after ```buyVouches``` or after ```sellVouches```
