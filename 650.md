# Lack of slippage on `sellVotes()`

### Summary

Lack of slippage on `sellVotes()`, this has an impact when users sell their votes and get less ETH than expected. 

Even though there is a `simulateSell()` function that functions as a simulation for users to estimate the ETH obtained when making a sale, this has no effect when the user makes an actual sale. This is because the price will change if there is another transaction (buying / selling votes) that occurs after the user calls `simulateSell()` and the price will change. 

Then the main problem here is that there is no slippage protection on the `sellVotes()` function, users cannot set the minimum ETH received when selling their votes. 

User may suffer significant loss if there is if someone makes a transaction (buy or sell) in large volumes, especially in markets that have a default configuration where prices will be very volatile.
