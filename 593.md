# Corruptible Upgradability Pattern

### Summary

The diagram below shows the inheritance of `EthosVouch.sol` and `ReputationMarket.sol`.
The main problem here is that both contracts inherit non-upgrade-safe contracts:

1. lack of storage gap
2. non upgradeable version, which lacks the initializer and upgradeable-compatible storage layout necessary for UUPS proxy systems

The contracts in blue are the non upgradeable versions.
The contracts in orange are missing gap.

`EthosVouch.sol`

`ReputationMarket.sol`
![ReputationMarket](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34c1fbe9-3629-4ad0-88ee-fddae84031ec)

Thus, adding new storage variables to any of these inherited contracts can potentially overwrite the beginning of the storage layout of the child contract. causing critical misbehaviors in the system.


### Root Cause

[EthosVouch.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L67) and [ReputationMarket.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L36) inherit non-upgrade-safe contracts

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol may suffer from uninitialized states and misaligned storage when upgrade occur

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add gaps on those contracts and use upgradeable library
