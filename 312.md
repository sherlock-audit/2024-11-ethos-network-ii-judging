# Total fees for ethos vouch may exceed 10% due to incorrect MAX_TOTAL_FEES

### Summary

One of the statements in the CONTEST README is the following.

>For both contracts:
Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%

This property may be violated in the `EthosVouch` contract because MAX_TOTAL_FEES is set incorrectly (10_000 instead of 1000).

To make sure of it, it is enough to consider the following [group of functions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L929)

```solidity
function applyFees(
    uint256 amount,
    bool isEntry,
    uint256 subjectProfileId
  ) internal returns (uint256 toDeposit, uint256 totalFees) {
    if (isEntry) {
      // Calculate entry fees
      uint256 protocolFee = calcFee(amount, entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints);
      uint256 donationFee = calcFee(amount, entryDonationFeeBasisPoints);
      uint256 vouchersPoolFee = calcFee(amount, entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints);

      // Distribute fees
      if (protocolFee > 0) {
        _depositProtocolFee(protocolFee);
      }
      if (donationFee > 0) {
        _depositRewards(donationFee, subjectProfileId);
      }
      if (vouchersPoolFee > 0) {
        // update the voucher pool fee to the amount actually distributed
        vouchersPoolFee = _rewardPreviousVouchers(vouchersPoolFee, subjectProfileId);
      }
      totalFees = protocolFee + donationFee + vouchersPoolFee;
      toDeposit = amount - totalFees;
    } else {
      // Calculate and apply exit fee
      uint256 exitFee = calcFee(amount, exitFeeBasisPoints);

      if (exitFee > 0) {
        _depositProtocolFee(exitFee);
      }
      totalFees = exitFee;
      toDeposit = amount - exitFee;
    }

    return (toDeposit, totalFees);
  }

function calcFee(uint256 total, uint256 feeBasisPoints) internal pure returns (uint256 fee) {
    return
      total -
      (total.mulDiv(BASIS_POINT_SCALE, (BASIS_POINT_SCALE + feeBasisPoints), Math.Rounding.Floor));
  }

function checkFeeExceedsMaximum(uint256 currentFee, uint256 newFee) internal view {
    uint256 totalFees = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints +
      exitFeeBasisPoints +
      entryDonationFeeBasisPoints +
      entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints +
      newFee -
      currentFee;
    if (totalFees > MAX_TOTAL_FEES) revert FeesExceedMaximum(totalFees, MAX_TOTAL_FEES);
  }
```



As we can see, the sum of entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints, entryDonationFeeBasisPoints, entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints, exitFeeBasisPoints cannot exceed 10_000. However, this is clearly too high a bound, as it shows that each individual fee can be `>= 0.5 total value`
(totalValue - totalValue * 10_000 / (10_000 + max(10_000))))

To make sure of this it is enough to consider the following group of functions

As we can see, the sum of entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints, entryDonationFeeBasisPoints, entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints, exitFeeBasisPoints cannot exceed 10_000. However, this is clearly too high a limit, as it shows that each individual fee can be `>= 0.5 total value`
`totalValue - totalValue * 10_000 / (10_000 + max(10_000))`.

After pointing out this error to the sponsor in the private thread, I was confirmed that 10_000 as MAX_TOTAL_FEES is a typo.

### Root Cause

Commissions may exceed 10% due to typo in MAX_TOTAL_FEES

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Breaks one of the invariants from contest README.

Note that this statement is in section with the following question
````Are there any restrictions on values set by admins (or other roles) in the codebase, including restrictions on array lengths?```

So even though the owner himself assigns basisPoints to each txes, the fact that the protocol does not validate his input correctly makes this issue medium severity.

### PoC

Fuzz test with echidna will easily find values that break this invariant
```solidity
function fuzzFees(uint256 total, uint256 basisPoints1, uint256 basisPoints2, uint256 basisPoints3, uint256 k) public {
        if (total < 0.001 ether) {
            total += 0.001 ether;
        }
        k %= 10000;
        basisPoints1 %= k;
        basisPoints2 %= ((10000 - k) / 2);
        basisPoints3 %= ((10000 - k) / 2);

        uint256 fees1 = total - (Math.mulDiv(total, 10_000, (10_000 + basisPoints1), Math.Rounding.Floor));
        uint256 fees2 = total - (Math.mulDiv(total, 10_000, (10_000 + basisPoints2), Math.Rounding.Floor));
        uint256 fees3 = total - (Math.mulDiv(total, 10_000, (10_000 + basisPoints3), Math.Rounding.Floor));

        assert(fees1 + fees2 + fees3 <= total / 10);
    }
```

### Mitigation

MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000
