# Inconsistent Fee in Voucher Rewards

### Summary

The protocol inconsistently handles rewards for voucher holders. When rewards are added directly to a voucher's balance, they are subject to withdrawal fees upon unvouching. However, leftover rewards (dust) deposited via _depositRewards are claimable without incurring any fees. If this behavior is intended, the dust rewards should also account for fees to maintain consistency across all reward mechanisms.



### Root Cause


In ``EthosProfile:_rewardPreviousVoucher``, The protocol adds rewards to the balance of a voucher, which is later subject to withdrawal fees. Meanwhile, leftover rewards (dust) are stored in a separate mapping (rewardsMapping) and can be claimed without any fees.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A user earns rewards from rewardPreviousVouchers.
2. The rewards are either:
   - Added to their vouch.balance, making them subject to withdrawal fees.
   - Sent to rewardsMapping as dust, claimable without fees.
3. Users withdrawing directly from their vouch.balance lose part of their rewards due to fees, while others claiming dust rewards from claimrewards avoid such fees.

### Impact

Voucher holders lose a portion of their earned rewards due to withdrawal fees applied to the balance.


### PoC


Rewards Added to Balance

```solidity
if (!vouch.archived) {
    uint256 reward = amount.mulDiv(vouch.balance, totalBalance, Math.Rounding.Floor);
    if (reward > 0) {
        vouch.balance += reward; // Rewards added to balance
        remainingRewards -= reward;
    }
}
```
Dust Rewards Deposited to Mapping rewards can call claimRewards to claim depositRewards.
```solidity

if (remainingRewards > 0) {
    _depositRewards(remainingRewards, subjectProfileId); // Dust rewards added to rewardsMapping
}

// Rewards added to rewardsMapping are claimable without fees
function _depositRewards(uint256 amount, uint256 recipientProfileId) internal {
    rewards[recipientProfileId] += amount;
    emit DepositedToRewards(recipientProfileId, amount);
}
```
Fee Deduction during Unvouching.
```solidity

function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) external {
    Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchId];
    uint256 withdrawAmount = vouch.balance;
    uint256 fee = calculateFee(withdrawAmount); // Fee applied on withdrawal
    uint256 finalAmount = withdrawAmount - fee;

    vouch.balance = 0;
    _transfer(msg.sender, finalAmount);
}
```

### Mitigation


Instead of directly adding rewards to vouch.balance, rewards should be deposited into the rewardsMapping for the respective voucher holders. This ensures all rewards are treated equally and can be claimed using the same mechanism (claimRewards) without being subject to withdrawal fees.

```solidity
if (!vouch.archived) {
    uint256 reward = amount.mulDiv(vouch.balance, totalBalance, Math.Rounding.Floor);
    if (reward > 0) {
        rewards[subjectProfileId]+= reward
        remainingRewards -= reward;
    }
}
```
