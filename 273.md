# Users can manipulate the buy price and buy votes at a lower one

### Summary

In volatile or expensive markets users would be able to implement a divergent buying, where instead of buying x number of votes they would buy 1 TRUST 1 DISTRUST at a time until they reach their desired number of votes, then they would sell the opposite. Even thought they are buying up and selling the opposite, they would still save on the total amount paid as the original vote they would have wished to buy would have increased with every buy.

Example:
| *prerequisites* | *values*     |
|-----------------|--------------|
| Base price      | 1e18 (1 ETH) |
| TRUST           | 10           |
| DISTRUST        | 10           |
| Fees            | 0%           |

Formula for calculating votes:

$$
\text{trustPrice} = \frac{{\text{votes[TRUST]} \cdot \text{basePrice}}}{{\text{votes[TRUST]} + \text{votes[DISTRUST]}}}
$$

$$
\text{distrustPrice} = \frac{{\text{votes[DISTRUST]} \cdot \text{basePrice}}}{{\text{votes[TRUST]} + \text{votes[DISTRUST]}}}
$$


Code for [_calcVotePrice](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L920-L923):
```solidity
  function _calcVotePrice(Market memory market, bool isPositive) private pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalVotes = market.votes[TRUST] + market.votes[DISTRUST];

    // votes[TRUST / DISTRUST] * basePrice / totalVotes
    return (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] * market.basePrice) / totalVotes;
  }
```
Normal buying (x can be T or D)
```mardown
x1  10 * 1e18 / 20 = 0.500000000000000000
x2  11 * 1e18 / 21 = 0.523809523809523809
x3  12 * 1e18 / 22 = 0.545454545454545454
x4  13 * 1e18 / 23 = 0.565217391304347826
x5  14 * 1e18 / 24 = 0.583333333333333333

x total price = 2.717814793901750422
```

Expanded way (first we buy x, then y)
```mardown
x1  10 * 1e18 / 20 = 0.500000000000000000
y1  10 * 1e18 / 21 = 0.476190476190476190

x2  11 * 1e18 / 22 = 0.500000000000000000
y2  11 * 1e18 / 23 = 0.478260869565217391

x3  12 * 1e18 / 24 = 0.500000000000000000
y3  12 * 1e18 / 25 = 0.480000000000000000

x4  13 * 1e18 / 26 = 0.500000000000000000
y4  13 * 1e18 / 27 = 0.481481481481481481

x5  14 * 1e18 / 28 = 0.500000000000000000
y5  14 * 1e18 / 29 = 0.482758620689655172

we sell all the y
y1  14 * 1e18 / 29 = 0.482758620689655172
y2  13 * 1e18 / 28 = 0.464285714285714285
y3  12 * 1e18 / 27 = 0.444444444444444444
y4  11 * 1e18 / 26 = 0.423076923076923076
y5  10 * 1e18 / 25 = 0.400000000000000000

x total price = 2.5 ETH
y total price = 2.398691447926830234
y sold for    = 2.214565702496736977

y loss   => 2.398691447926830234 - 2.214565702496736977 = 0.184125745430093257
x saved => 2.717814793901750422 - 2.5 = 0.217814793901750422
```

As you can see we lost ~0.184 ETH buying `y`, however we saved up ~0.217 on `x` thanks to this strategy. That is 0.0336 ETH, however keep in mind that we have only bought 5 votes, the bigger the buy the bigger the saved up amounts. That is also true for volatile markets where small buys have big impacts and thus big savings using this strategy. With fees the same strategy is possible, as the fee would still impact the normal way and our way in about the same manner.

We can also do this in 1 TX in order to avoid any malicious users taking advantage of our strategies. 


### Root Cause

The formula being used to calculate the votes

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User wants to buy some votes in a volatile market
2. He makes a TX buying votes 1 T and 1 D at a time and then selling the ones he doesn't want
3. User saves up on total costs compared to other users, effectively gaming the market

### Impact

Users games the market.
User saves up on total costs compared to other users

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The issues comes from the formula used. I can suggest to restrict each account to having either TRUST or DISTRUST for their vote, however that would restrict users in a bad way.
