# Incorrect Inclusion of Fees in Market Funds Calculation in `ReputationMarket::buyVotes()`

### Summary

Fees and Donations are incorrectly included in MarketFunds when they are added to funds paid that is calculated in [ReputationMarket::_calculateBuy()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L978)
```solidity
while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
      fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
 @>>  fundsPaid += votePrice;
      votesBought++;

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    }
 @>> fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation; //donation and protocol fees added to funds paid

```
funds paid contains the total amount to be spent on votes, but then the protocol fee and donations are added to it .


When used in `ReputationMarket::buyVotes()` :
Calculate the funds to be paid which include the addition of fees.
`applyFees(protocolFee, donation, profileId);` apply fees is later called after calculating the buy which send the appropriate fee amount to their destination and set the donation for the market owner.
These fees are no longer owned by the reputation market contract (what is still on the contract has been allocated for donations)
but the fundsPaid calculation still include these fees when adding to the total funds spent on the market (marketFunds)

```solidity
// tally market funds
// this tally market funds + fees and donations
marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
```
which is incorrect as the fees and donations were not spent in the market and has already been processed and allocated.

### Root Cause

in [ReputationMarket::_calculateBuy()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L942)

```solidity
 function _calculateBuy( Market memory market, bool isPositive, uint256 funds ) private view returns (uint256 votesBought,  uint256 fundsPaid, uint256 newVotePrice, uint256 protocolFee, uint256 donation, uint256 minVotePrice, uint256 maxVotePrice ) {
    uint256 fundsAvailable;
    (fundsAvailable, protocolFee, donation) = previewFees(funds, true);
    uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    ...
    while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
      fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
      fundsPaid += votePrice;
      votesBought++;
    ...
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    }
    fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation; //fees and donation being added
    ...
    return (votesBought, fundsPaid, votePrice, protocolFee, donation, minPrice, maxPrice);
  }
```
The total funds paid (fundsPaid) adds fees and donation to it and it's returned in the view function

in [ReputationMarket::buyVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442C12-L442C20)

```solidity

function buyVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 expectedVotes,
    uint256 slippageBasisPoints
  ) public payable whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
     ...
    // Determine how many votes can be bought with the funds provided
    (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid, // funds spent on buying votes + fees + donations 
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);
    _checkSlippageLimit(votesBought, expectedVotes, slippageBasisPoints);
    // Apply fees first
    // Apply fees and donations (send fees to protocol fee recipient and tally donations to be withdrawn)
    applyFees(protocolFee, donation, profileId);

    // Update market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += votesBought;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += votesBought;
    ...
    // Calculate and refund remaining funds
    // fundsPaid = total spent on votes + fees + donations
    uint256 refund = msg.value - fundsPaid; // this refunds the user any balance left after the purchase
    if (refund > 0) _sendEth(refund);

    // tally market funds
    // fees and donations are added to the tally which is incorrect cause
    // both fees and donations have already been paid out and are not in the market.
    marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
    ...
  }

```
which results in an overstatement of the total market funds. This incorrect inclusion can lead to the contract becoming insolvent, as it allocates funds that are no longer on the contract or funds that has already been allocated for witdrawal.

when `ReputationMarket::withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()` is called for that market, it will withdraw the marketFunds for the market
```solidity
function withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(uint256 profileId) public whenNotPaused {
    address authorizedAddress = contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(
      "GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL"
    );
    if (msg.sender != authorizedAddress) {
      revert UnauthorizedWithdrawal();
    }
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);
    if (!graduatedMarkets[profileId]) {
      revert MarketNotGraduated();
    }
    if (marketFunds[profileId] == 0) {
      revert InsufficientFunds();
    }

    _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]); // the market funds will be sent to authorizedAddress
    emit MarketFundsWithdrawn(profileId, msg.sender, marketFunds[profileId]);
    marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
  }
```
The market funds, which incorrectly consist of the total amount spent on votes plus fees and donations, may be withdrawn from the contract. This will lead to contract insolvency because fees that have already been distributed and donations that have already been withdrawn by market owners are being withdrawn again.



### Internal pre-conditions
1. Protocol fees and donation fees are set
### External pre-conditions

None
### Attack Path

1. UserA sends 100eth to buy trust votes for a marketId, spends 3% on fees (entry fee 200, donation fee 100), total funds left to purchase votes is 97eth (neglecting if there would be any remaining funds left), 100eth is added to the marketFunds when 2eth has been sent to protocol fee recipient and 1eth is available for claiming by market owners.




### Impact

- The contract will face insolvency since it allows funds to be withdrawn that were already disbursed as fees or donations.
- Since fees and donations are counted as part of `MarketFunds` and can be withdrawn again when graduating the market, it results in a form of double spending.
- Since fees and donations are added to the market funds, the market funds will appear larger than it actually is.
- This can break the invariant `The vouch and vault contracts must never revert a transaction due to running out of funds.`

### PoC
add this to `rep.market.test.ts` and run the test 
```solidity
it('should add fees to marketFunds and revert on withdrawal of over-allocated marketFunds', async () => {

### Mitigation

After refunding the user the remaining funds, the fees and donations should be subtracted from `fundsPaid` before adding it to the `marketFunds`
