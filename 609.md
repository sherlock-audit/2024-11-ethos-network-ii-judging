# seller will get less amount then intended

### Summary

The `sellVotes` functionality is intended to calculate the selling price of votes dynamically.
The calculation involves:

- Determining the current price of a vote based on the existing vote count.
- Adjusting the vote count after each vote sale.
- Recalculating the price after the updated count to reflect the reduced vote value.
This mechanism is designed to ensure that selling votes mirrors the behavior of buying votes, where the price is updated based on the current vote count after every transaction.

### Attack Path

The `_calculateSell` function exhibits a logical flaw in how it calculates and accumulates the funds received during the sale of votes. Below is a breakdown of the issue:

**Current Implementation Logic**

- The function first calculates the current vote price based on the existing vote count.
- It then decreases the vote count without adding the vote's current price to fundsReceived.
- The vote price is recalculated with the updated vote count, and only then is fundsReceived increased by the recalculated price.
- This process continues in a loop for the number of votes sold.

**Flaw in the Calculation**

- The first vote sold does not account for the current price of the vote; instead, the seller receives funds based on the price after the count is decremented.
- As the price decreases with every vote sold, the seller receives less ETH than they should.

### Impact

- The seller is underpaid as the calculation ignores the current price of the vote during the first iteration.
- The decreasing price per vote further compounds the underpayment issue, leading to a cumulative shortfall in the ETH received by the seller.

### PoC

### Mitigation

- The protocol should ensure that the current price of the vote is considered and that `fundReceived` is updated accordingly before reducing the vote count. 
- The calculation for buying votes is accurate, so refer to it as a reference.
