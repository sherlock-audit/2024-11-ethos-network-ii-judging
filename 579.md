# Corruptible Upgradeable Pattern

### Summary

`EthosVouch` and `ReputationMarket` are UUPSUpgradeable. However, the current implementation has multiple issues regarding upgradability. Additionally, the contract storage does not adhere to the EIP1967 proxy storage slot standard. The lack of gaps in the storage between the underlying contracts may lead to storage conflicts during upgrades.

### Root Cause

The Ethos contracts are meant to be upgradeable. However, it inherits contracts that are not upgrade-safe.

Following is the inheritance chain of the Ethos Contracts:

```js
EthosVouch
    ┌── AccessControl (includes IPausable, PausableUpgradeable, AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable, SignatureControl)
    ├── UUPSUpgradeable
    ├── ITargetStatus
    └── ReentrancyGuard

ReputationMarket
    ┌── AccessControl (includes IPausable, PausableUpgradeable, AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable, SignatureControl)
    ├── UUPSUpgradeable
    └── ReentrancyGuard
```

In  `AccessControl` and `SignatureControl`  storage slots are present but there are no gaps implemented.

Also, `EthosVouch` and `ReputationMarket` inherits the non-upgradeable version `ReentrancyGuard` from Openzeppelin's library, when it should use the upgradeable version(`ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable`) from [openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable) lib.

In upgradeable contracts, maintaining a consistent storage layout is critical to prevent issues during upgrades, as each contract upgrade relies on an unchanged storage structure to function correctly. The current implementation of `ReentrancyGuard` and missing `strorage gaps` does not adhere to the requirements for upgradeable contracts and can lead to storage clashes during upgrades.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Admin Update the contract and modify the storage.


### Impact

Storage of vault contracts might be corrupted during upgrading.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Add gaps in AccessControl, SignatureControl
2. Use library from Openzeppelin-upgradeable instead, e.g. `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable`
