# Users can unvouch during the 24-hour evaluation period.

### Summary

According to the whitepaper, there will be a 24-hour evaluation period once the profile is flagged for slashing but user can always unvouch in that period and prevent slashing. 

### Root Cause

According to the docs once the profile is flagged for slashing, it should prevent the staking and withdrawal from that profile. 

> Any Ethos participant may act as a "whistleblower" to accuse another participant of inaccurate claims or unethical behavior. This accusation triggers a 24h lock on staking (and withdrawals) for the accused.
> 

but if we have a look at the `EthosVouch:unvouch` function then there is nothing preventing the unvouch if the profile is flagged for slashing.

```solidity
function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
    _vouchShouldExist(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);
    // because it's $$$, you can only withdraw/unvouch to the same address you used to vouch
    // however, we don't care about the status of the address's profile; funds are always attached
    // to an address, not a profile
    if (vouches[vouchId].authorAddress != msg.sender) {
      revert AddressNotVouchAuthor(vouchId, msg.sender, vouches[vouchId].authorAddress);
    }

    v.archived = true;
    // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
    v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt = block.timestamp;
    // remove the vouch from the tracking arrays and index mappings
    _removeVouchFromArrays(v);

    // apply fees and determine how much is left to send back to the author
    (uint256 toWithdraw, ) = applyFees(v.balance, false, v.subjectProfileId);
    // set the balance to 0 and save back to storage
    v.balance = 0;
    // send the funds to the author
    // note: it sends it to the same address that vouched; not the one that called unvouch
    (bool success, ) = payable(v.authorAddress).call{ value: toWithdraw }("");
    if (!success) {
      revert FeeTransferFailed("Failed to send ETH to author");
    }

    emit Unvouched(v.vouchId, v.authorProfileId, v.subjectProfileId);
  }
```

This user can always unvouch in  24-hour period and prevent his profile from being slashed.Apart from this he also has the power to mark someone unhealthy and if he is malicious he will use it to deteriorate the reputation of the subject.

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

none

### Impact

Malicious users cannot get slashed and he have the power to make someone unhealthy without any cost. 

### PoC

none

### Mitigation

The code should check if the profile is pending for slashing and if it is then unvouch should revert or  it should only allow the user to unvouch 90% and lock 10% of funds until 24 hours is passed.
