# users funds loss and/or transaction reverts due to out of funds in ReputationMarket contract

### Summary

 In current ReputationMarket contract logic, marketFunds[profileId] state variable was wrongly updated.Due to which entryprotocolfee+donationfee was wrongly collected twice from contract in 2 different ways.1) directly when buying votes.2)In form of withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds.
which will make future transactions revert due to insufficient Eth balance of ReputationMarket, eventually users loss funds.

### Root Cause

If users wants to buy votes then they call ReputationMarket::buyVotes function
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442
Then it internally calls _calculateBuy function which will returns votesBought, fundsPaid, protocolFee,donation,minVotePrice,maxVotePrice
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L451-L459
now let's see _calculateBuy function logic,
It internally calls previewFees function to calculate protocolFee,donation and fundsAvailable after deducting protocolFee+donation from msg.value.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L960
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1141-L1153
Then it calculates no of votes user can buy with remaining fundsAvailable and fundsPaid to buy those votes.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L970-L976
until now fundsPaid = amount used to buy votes.
but now we are adding protocolfee+donation to fundsPaid making it,fundsPaid = amount used to buyvotes + protocolFee+donation.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L978
Then buyVotes function internally calls applyFees function to send protocol fee to protocal and update donationEscrow variable such that profileId owner can withdraw donations.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L464
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1116-L1127
now it updates marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481
In this whole process, first we are sending protocol fee to protocol and adding donations to donationEscrow[profileId].
and again we are adding fundsPaid to marketFunds[profileId] .
marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid which equals to 
marketFunds[profileId] += amount to buy votes +protocolFee+donations.as fundsPaid is wrongly updated to amount to buy votes +protocolFee+donations instead of amount to buy votes.
After graduation of a market, user with role GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL can withdraw marketFunds(marketFunds[profileId]).
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L660-L678
which means protocolFee+donation was collecting twice from the contract which will break accounting of the contract.
so  user transactions in future  will revert due to out of funds(contract not having enough Eth to give to users who sell there votes and while withdrawing GraduatedMarketFunds).

### Attack Path

### Impact

wrongly collecting protocolFee+donation from ReputationMarket twice for every time  a user buys votes, which will break accounting of the contract(Eth balance of contract is not enough to pay to users who sell their votes and at time of withdrawing GraduatedMarketFunds  in future).so users loss there funds.

### Mitigation

modify code here,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481
with this,
```marketFunds[profileId] += (fundsPaid-protocolFee-donation);```
so that marketFunds[profileId] is correctly updated.
