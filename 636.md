# Wrong `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` To Be Inputed

### Summary

Wrong value is hardcoded in `MAX_TOTAL_FEES`.


### Root Cause

README :

> Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%

However the contract (EthosVouch) hardcoded the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` as 10000 or 100 % which don't reflect as the readme says

```solidity
  uint256 private constant ABSOLUTE_MINIMUM_VOUCH_AMOUNT = 0.0001 ether;
  uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
  uint256 public constant BASIS_POINT_SCALE = 10000;
```

### Mitigation

```diff
  uint256 private constant ABSOLUTE_MINIMUM_VOUCH_AMOUNT = 0.0001 ether;
- uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
+ uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000;
  uint256 public constant BASIS_POINT_SCALE = 10000;
```
