# A logic flaw in the `buyVotes` function leads to misrepresentation of market liquidity

### Summary

A logic flaw in the `buyVotes` function leads to misrepresentation of market liquidity. Specifically, the `marketFunds[profileId]` calculation assumes all paid funds contribute directly to market liquidity. So, the recorded liquidity does not reflect the actual state, allowing for inaccurate market calculations and potential manipulation.

### Root Cause

In the `buyVotes` function, the following line:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481
naively assumes that `fundsPaid` entirely contributes to the market's liquidity. However, if any portion of `msg.value` is refunded (via `_sendEth(refund)`) or consumed by fees (e.g., `protocolFee` or donation), the recorded `marketFunds` value can misrepresent the actual liquidity.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442-L493
Problem:
1. The `applyFees` function reduces the effective funds available for liquidity, but this reduction is not subtracted from `marketFunds`.
2. If any refund occurs (`refund > 0`), this amount does not reduce the `marketFunds` tally.
3. An overstated `marketFunds` value can lead to misleading liquidity metrics, enabling attackers to exploit this discrepancy for profit.

Also, in function `_calculateBuy` deducts `protocolFee` and `donation` from `funds` using `previewFees`, calculating the actual funds available for purchasing votes. However, after the loop completes, any leftover funds (`fundsAvailable`) are not refunded but instead remain unaccounted for.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L942-L983
The line `fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation` adds fees to the total amount `fundsPaid`. This creates a disconnect because `fundsPaid` is supposed to represent the actual amount used to buy votes. Including fees here might lead to discrepancies in calculations elsewhere in the contract.

If `fundsAvailable < votePrice` after the loop, the leftover funds are not explicitly handled. These funds should either:
Be refunded to the buyer, or
Be accounted for transparently in `fundsPaid`.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Deploy a market with initial liquidity.
2. Call `buyVotes` with `msg.value` greater than the required funds to trigger a refund.
3. Check that `marketFunds` includes the refunded amount, inflating the perceived liquidity.

Values:
Market initial liquidity: 1 ETH
Call `buyVotes` with:
`msg.value` = 2 ETH
Required funds: 1.5 ETH
Refund: 0.5 ETH

Output:
Refund of 0.5 ETH is sent back to the caller.
`marketFunds` is updated as if the full 2 ETH was added, overstating liquidity by 0.5 ETH.

Another scenario:
1. The buyer sends more ETH (`msg.value`) than needed to buy votes. After purchasing all possible votes within the budget, some funds remain as `fundsAvailable`.
2. Any leftover funds (`fundsAvailable`) are neither refunded to the buyer nor properly accounted for in `marketFunds`.

### Impact

Overstating market liquidity misleads participants about the actual market state.

Attackers can exploit inflated liquidity values to manipulate vote prices or liquidity-dependent calculations.

The user may overpay for votes without a refund.

### PoC

```solidity
it("Should misrepresent liquidity after a refund in buyVotes", async () => {
  const marketId = 1; // Example market ID
  const [owner, user] = await ethers.getSigners();

  // Assume initial market setup is complete
  await contract.createMarket(); // Example market creation

  // User buys votes with excess ETH
  const tx = await contract.connect(user).buyVotes(
    marketId,
    true, // isPositive
    10, // expectedVotes
    1000, // slippageBasisPoints
    { value: ethers.utils.parseEther("2") }
  );

  // Check refund (Mock _sendEth to observe refund call)
  const refundAmount = ethers.utils.parseEther("0.5");
  expect(await user.getBalance()).to.equal(userInitialBalance.sub(refundAmount));

  // Liquidity Misrepresentation
  const marketFunds = await contract.marketFunds(marketId);
  expect(marketFunds).to.equal(ethers.utils.parseEther("2")); // Incorrect
});
```
Output:
0.5 ETH refunded successfully.
`marketFunds` incorrectly includes refunded amount, recorded as 2 ETH instead of 1.5 ETH.

### Mitigation

Subtract both refunds and fees when updating `marketFunds`.
```solidity
marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation - refund;
```
