# Users cannot unvouch at any time

### Summary

Whenever protocol is paused - users will not be able to withdraw funds

### Root Cause

According to [docs/whitepaper](https://whitepaper.ethos.network/ethos-mechanisms/vouch)
> You may withdraw your staked funds at any time by unvouching.

Which isn't true:

```solidity
  function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
    _vouchShouldExist(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);
    // because it's $$$, you can only withdraw/unvouch to the same address you used to vouch
    // however, we don't care about the status of the address's profile; funds are always attached
    // to an address, not a profile
    if (vouches[vouchId].authorAddress != msg.sender) {
      revert AddressNotVouchAuthor(vouchId, msg.sender, vouches[vouchId].authorAddress);
    }

    v.archived = true;
    // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
    v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt = block.timestamp;
    // remove the vouch from the tracking arrays and index mappings
    _removeVouchFromArrays(v);

    // apply fees and determine how much is left to send back to the author
    (uint256 toWithdraw, ) = applyFees(v.balance, false, v.subjectProfileId);
    // set the balance to 0 and save back to storage
    v.balance = 0;
    // send the funds to the author
    // note: it sends it to the same address that vouched; not the one that called unvouch
    (bool success, ) = payable(v.authorAddress).call{ value: toWithdraw }("");
    if (!success) {
      revert FeeTransferFailed("Failed to send ETH to author");
    }

    emit Unvouched(v.vouchId, v.authorProfileId, v.subjectProfileId);
  }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

protocol paused contract

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

invariant doesn't hold, users should be able to withdraw funds at any time. User will lose access to funds when protocol paused

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
-  function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
+  function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public nonReentrant {
    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
```
