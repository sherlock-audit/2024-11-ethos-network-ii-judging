# Vouchers pool rewards are always taxed

### Summary

In [`EthosVouch::_rewardPreviousVouchers`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L697), when previous vouchers receive rewards from a new voucher, their reward is added to their vouch.balance. This is an issue because when they unvouch, they will taxed for exiting. The idea of increasing vouchers' balance is to enable autocompounding, but this as said will tax their rewards, which is not what the users expect.
The solution to this is to use [`EthosVouch::_depositRewards`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L687) for rewarding previous vouchers or introduce a flag for auto-compounding and leave the users to decide whether they want to use auto compounding


### Root Cause

In [`EthosVouch::_rewardPreviousVouchers`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L697) the rewards of the previous vouchers is rewarded with increasing their balance instead of depositing it to their rewards.

### Internal pre-conditions

### Mitigation

Introduce a flag for enabling auto-compounding or use [`EthosVouch::_depositRewards`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L687) to distribute the vouchers' rewards
