# Reorg vulnerability could lead users to create a market with unintended config in ReputationMarket.sol::createMarketWithConfig

### Summary

In some cases reorgs on the chain could direct users to create market with unintended config resulting in potential loss of funds and unexpected costs / configurations. 

### Root Cause

This is due to marketConfig to create a market is identified only by an integer index  making it vulnerable in a reorg scenario.  
If a reorg alters the sequence of transactions, the chosed marketConfig index pointing in ReputationMarket.sol::marketConfigs while a user calls ReputationMarket.sol::createMarketWithConfig could end up pointing to a different marketConfig when the call is processed so market will be created with a different configuration.  
 
In ReputationMarket.sol:L281 (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L281) createMarketWithConfig takes the marketConfig index to be used by configuration.  

However, if ReputationMarket.sol::marketConfigs changes between user call createMarketWithConfig and call execution then market could be created with an unexpected config     


### Internal pre-conditions

Suppose A,B two marketConfigs and user U who wants to create a market M  
1. User  create a new market with config A so it calls createMarketWithConfig(marketConfigs.indexOf(A))  
2. Admin wants to remove A config, so calls removeMarketConfig(marketConfigs.indexOf(A)), now previous last marketConfig in array has the index of A
3. Reorg happens so, A configuration is removed first, and market is created with unintended marketConfig


### External pre-conditions

Not applicable

### Attack Path

A numbered list of steps, talking through the attack path:
1. User creates a new market with config A so it calls createMarketWithConfig(marketConfigs.indexOf(A))  
2. Admin wants to remove A config, so calls removeMarketConfig(marketConfigs.indexOf(A)), now previous last marketConfig in array has the index of A
3. Reorg happens so, A configuration is removed first, and market is created with unintended marketConfig


### Impact

User creates a market config with unintended configuration, leading to unexpected results 

### PoC

NA

### Mitigation

Include a market non sequential config string id (strId) in marketConfig struct, and require that both marketConfigIndex and StrIndex match before creating the market:  
```solidity
  struct MarketConfig {
    uint256 initialLiquidity;
    uint256 initialVotes;
    uint256 basePrice;
@>    string strId;
  }
  //...
  function createMarketWithConfig(
    uint256 marketConfigIndex,
@>    string marketConfigStrId ){
    //...
@>    _createMarket(senderProfileId, msg.sender, marketConfigIndex,marketConfigStrId)
  } 
  
  //...
  function _createMarket(
    uint256 profileId,
    address recipient,
    uint256 marketConfigIndex,
@>    string marketConfigStrId
  ) private nonReentrant {
    //...
    require(marketConfigStrId == marketConfigs[marketConfigIndex].strId, "marketConfig Id missmatch");
    //...
  }
