# Lack of slippage protection in `sellVotes` causes loss of user funds

## Vulnerability Details
In `ReputationMarket.sol`'s `sellVotes`:
```solidity
function sellVotes(
  uint256 profileId,
  bool isPositive,
  uint256 amount
) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
  _checkMarketExists(profileId);

  // calculate the amount of votes to sell and the funds received
  (
    uint256 votesSold,
    uint256 fundsReceived,
    ,
    uint256 protocolFee,
    uint256 minVotePrice,
    uint256 maxVotePrice
  ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);

  // update the market state
  markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
  votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;

  // apply protocol fees
  applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

  // send the proceeds to the seller
  _sendEth(fundsReceived);
  // tally market funds
  marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
  emit VotesSold(
    profileId,
    msg.sender,
    isPositive,
    votesSold,
    fundsReceived,
    block.timestamp,
    minVotePrice,
    maxVotePrice
  );
  _emitMarketUpdate(profileId);
}
```

Unlike when buying votes, there is no slippage protection when selling votes, users sale will go through **no matter how low the price may have plummented** at the point of time it gets processed.

## Impact
Let's say `Alice` is selling TRUST votes, right before her transaction gets processed, another whale could have sold alot of TRUST votes or bought a hugh amount of DISTRUST votes, causing the price of TRUST votes to plummet way below the price Alice intended to sell at.

Alice might not want to sell at that price and she could have intended to wait instead of selling if the price is currently so low. The total lack of slippage protection implies upto ~100% loss for Alice.

Since this is a loss of up to ~100% funds, this is definietely high impact.

## Recommendation
Just like `buyVotes`, allow the user to pass in a slippage protection paramter in `sellVotes`.
