# Upgrading either of the contracts might cause a storage collision

### Summary

Both [EthosVouch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L67) and [ReputationMarket](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L36) are upgradeable contracts, and they inherit from `UUPSUpgradeable`, however, the protocol's custom [AccessControl](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/AccessControl.sol) contract lacks storage gaps, which might lead to storage collisions and therefore upgradeability issues.

### Root Cause

Two of the main contracts inherit from the contract [AccessControl](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/AccessControl.sol), which does not have storage gaps.

### Attack Path

The admin decides to upgrade [EthosVouch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol) or [ReputationMarket](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol) (or both). After they execute the upgrade, a storage collision occurs and the contracts continue to operate, but their storage layout is incorrect, and therefore they are operating with wrong data.

### Impact

Storage collision in [EthosVouch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol) and [ReputationMarket](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol)
