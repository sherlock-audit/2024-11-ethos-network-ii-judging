# Anyone who `vouch` for any `profileId` can `unvouch` and call `markUnhealthy` even they are not mutually vouched (3,3)

### Summary

Unvouch [documentation](https://whitepaper.ethos.network/ethos-mechanisms/vouch#unvouch) stating that if the vouches are mutually vouched (3,3), the person who doing unvouch can mark the unvouch as unhealty within 24 hours to signal to the network the vouch ended on poor terms.
However such implementation is not exist in the contract, so no one needs the vouch to be mutually vouched to mark the unvouch as unhealty.

### Root Cause

Function [`EthosVouch::markUnhealthy`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L496-L510) does not check if the corresponding `subjectId` and author of `vouchId` are mutually vouched to each other.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path


1. alice vouch bob and got vouchId 1
2. alice unvouch and markUnhealthy bob
3. alice vouch bob again, now with vouchId 2
4. alice unvouch and markUnhealthy bob
   
repeat until bob have a bad reputation by having multiple vouch that marked as unhealthy

### Impact

1. anyone can grief the reputation of any `profileId` by exploiting the attack path.
2. core concept `unhealthy` became unreliable stats for any `profileId` because of this exploit is so easy to do

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

to support the planned core concept, the suggestion is to add check on `EthosVouch::markUnhealthy` to check if the vouch actually mutually vouched to each other (3,3)
