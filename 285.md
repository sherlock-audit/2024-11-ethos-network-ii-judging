# There is not slippage check for final vouch's balance

### Summary

User could not know exact final value of his future vouch, when he send tx for creating/increasing vouch. Because fee could be changed at anytime by admin.

### Root Cause

in `EthosVouch.sol:402` there is not slippage protection from fee changing. User could not control final amount of his vouch, because fee could be changed by admin at any time.
