# Updating the `unhealthyResponsePeriod` also impacts past vouches

### Summary

Currently, a voucher can decide whether to mark a vouch as unhealthy, as long as the `unhealthyResponsePeriod` has not expired since they unvouched. However, users may still be able to mark a vouch as unhealthy even after the `unhealthyResponsePeriod` has already passed before, if the `unhealthyResponsePeriod` is extended.

### Root Cause

When it is checked whether the author [still has time](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L857-L858) to mark a vouch as unhealthy, the current `unhealthyResponsePeriod` is used instead of the one that was in effect when the user unvouched.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Alice vouches for ProfileA.
2. Alice calls `EthosVouch::unvouch()` to revoke her vouch because she has lost trust in the profile she previously vouched for. She can mark the vouch as unhealthy until the `unhealthyResponsePeriod` (currently set to `24 hours`) expires.
3. The `unhealthyResponsePeriod` expires.
4. Twelve hours later, `updateUnhealthyResponsePeriod()` is called to increase the unhealthy response period to `48 hours`.
5. Now, Alice can call `EthosVouch::markUnhealthy()`, even though the `unhealthyResponsePeriod` has already expired once.

### Impact

Users will still be able to mark a vouch as unhealthy, even if the `unhealthyResponsePeriod` at the time of unvouching has already expired. This means that even vouches that have been unvouched for several months could be marked as unhealthy if the `unhealthyResponsePeriod` was extended long enough. 

As a result, vouchers can mark a vouch as unhealthy, even if they did not distrust the subject when they unvouched it. This increases the risk of manipulation of the protocol's reputation system.

### PoC

The following test should be added in `EthosVouch.test.ts`:

```solidity
    it('should succeed marking vouch unhealthy when unhealthyResponsePeriod extended', async () => {
      const {
        ethosProfile,
        ethosVouch,
        ADMIN,
        OWNER,
        PROFILE_CREATOR_0,
        VOUCHER_0,
      } = await loadFixture(deployFixture);
  
      await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address);
      await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_0).createProfile(1);

      await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(VOUCHER_0.address);
      await ethosProfile.connect(VOUCHER_0).createProfile(1);
  
      expect(await ethosProfile.profileIdByAddress(PROFILE_CREATOR_0.address)).to.be.equal(
        2,
        'wrong profile Id',
      );
        
      await ethosVouch.connect(VOUCHER_0).vouchByProfileId(2, DEFAULT_COMMENT, DEFAULT_METADATA, {
        value: ethers.parseEther('1.1'),
      });

      expect(await ethosVouch.vouchCount()).to.equal(1, 'Wrong vouchCount');

      await ethosVouch.connect(ADMIN).updateUnhealthyResponsePeriod(86400);
      expect(await ethosVouch.unhealthyResponsePeriod()).to.equal(
        86400,
        'Wrong unhealthyResponsePeriod, 0',
      );

      await ethosVouch.connect(VOUCHER_0).unvouch(0);

      await time.increase(100);

      await time.increase(await ethosVouch.unhealthyResponsePeriod());

      await expect(ethosVouch.connect(VOUCHER_0).markUnhealthy(0))
        .to.be.revertedWithCustomError(ethosVouch, 'CannotMarkVouchAsUnhealthy')
        .withArgs(0);

      await ethosVouch.connect(ADMIN).updateUnhealthyResponsePeriod(172800);
      expect(await ethosVouch.unhealthyResponsePeriod()).to.equal(
        172800,
        'Wrong unhealthyResponsePeriod, 1',
      );

      await time.increase(43100);

      await ethosVouch.connect(VOUCHER_0).markUnhealthy(0)
    });
```

### Mitigation

Only the `unhealthyResponsePeriod` at the time a user unvouches should be considered when `EthosVouch::markUnhealthy()` is called, so that once this period expires, the user will no longer be able to mark a vouch as unhealthy.
