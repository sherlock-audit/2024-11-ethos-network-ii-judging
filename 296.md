# Missing Deadline Parameter in `buyVotes()` and `sellVotes()` Functions

## Description

**Context:**

Users buy Trust/Distrust votes from the Reputation Market, predicting that other users will later buy the same vote type they purchased. This allows them to sell their votes at a higher price, earning a profit from the price rise.

**Vulnerability Details:** 

The functions responsible for [buying](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442-L493) and [selling](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L534) votes are missing a `deadline` parameter. If a transaction is delayed, users may unknowingly execute trades that are not in their favor.

While the `buyVotes()` function includes a slippage check, it does not guarantee that a non-reverted trade outcome, is in the best interest of the buyer or seller in case the transaction gets delayed.

## Impact

**Damage:** High

**Likelihood:** Low

**Details:** Users may unknowingly execute unfavorable trades, resulting in fewer votes being bought or sold than expected, due to transaction delays and the price changes that occur during those delays.

## Proof of Concept

**Attack Path:**

1. A user attempts to buy votes from the reputation market by calling the `buyVotes()` function with `10 ETH` (hypothetically, lets say each vote costs 1 ETH) and allowing up to `30% slippage`.
2. The user expects to receive `10 votes` in return. Unfortunately, the user transaction is delayed by `4â€“5 blocks`, and others transactions are mined first.
3. Due to the delay and subsequent price changes caused by other users vote buy/sell transactions, the initial user ends up receiving only `8 votes` instead of the expected `10`.

**POC:**

- Not Needed

## Recommended Mitigation

Add a `deadline` parameter to the `buyVotes()` and `sellVotes()` functions. This parameter will allow users to specify a `block.timestamp` after which the trade should expire, preventing unfavorable trade outcomes due to transaction delays.
