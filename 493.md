# User could not or never (in some condition) `markUnhealthy` a `vouchId`

### Summary

A user could not or never (in some condition) mark a `vouch` as `unhealthy` because the [EthosVouch::markUnhealthy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L496) has `whenNotPaused` modifier.

### Impact

It will never be possible to mark a `vouchId` as `unhealthy` (if paused for 24 hours).
Because `paused time` will affect the `_vouchShouldBePossibleUnhealthy`'s time (more described on the PoC)

So as a result a `vouchId` becomes `healthy` `forever`,
unless the admin update the `unhealthyResponsePeriod` as possible unhealthy's `block.timestamp <= v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt + unhealthyResponsePeriod`

[EthosVouch::_vouchShouldBePossibleUnhealthy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L857C1-L858C67)

```solidity
  /**
   * @notice Fails if vouch cannot be set as unhealthy.
   * @dev Checks if vouch can be set as unhealthy.
   * @param vouchId Vouch Id.
   */
  function _vouchShouldBePossibleUnhealthy(uint256 vouchId) private view {
    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
@>  bool stillHasTime = block.timestamp <=
      v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt + unhealthyResponsePeriod;

    if (!v.archived || v.unhealthy || !stillHasTime) {
@>    revert CannotMarkVouchAsUnhealthy(vouchId);
    }
  }
```

[EthosVouch::updateUnhealthyResponsePeriod](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L655C1-L663C4)

```solidity
  /**
   * @dev Updates time period for unhealthy response.
   * @param unhealthyResponsePeriodDuration Time period.
   */
  function updateUnhealthyResponsePeriod(
    uint256 unhealthyResponsePeriodDuration
  ) external onlyAdmin whenNotPaused {
    unhealthyResponsePeriod = unhealthyResponsePeriodDuration;
  }
```

### * But it is not a good behavior of a great protocol to `update time` `only because` this problem occurs.
### * Even if the contract is `paused` for `1 hour` or only `5 minutes`, then the user actually gets only `23 hours 55 mins` to mark `unhealthy` which breaks Ethos Network's promises.

### User should get the whole `24 hours` or the whole `unhealthyResponsePeriod` time for `mark unhealthy` as promised in `Etho's Whitepaper`

### PoC

* Not possible to call [EthosVouch::markUnhealthy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L496) when the contract is `paused`.

```solidity
  /**
   * @dev Marks vouch as unhealthy.
   * @param vouchId Vouch Id.
   */
  function markUnhealthy(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused { <@
    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
    uint256 profileId = IEthosProfile(
      contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
    ).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);

    _vouchShouldExist(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnhealthy(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBelongToAuthor(vouchId, profileId);
    v.unhealthy = true;
    // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
    v.activityCheckpoints.unhealthyAt = block.timestamp;

    emit MarkedUnhealthy(v.vouchId, v.authorProfileId, v.subjectProfileId);
  }
```

* From Ethos Network Whitepaper we can see [Whitepaper->vouch#unvouch](https://whitepaper.ethos.network/ethos-mechanisms/vouch#unvouch)

```solidity
Unvouch
You may withdraw your staked funds at any time by unvouching. 
You cannot modify the amount staked in a vouch without withdrawing the entire vouch. 

ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ See those lines
If you are mutually vouched (3,3) and unvouch, 
the person who was vouched can mark a vouch as "unhealthy" within 24 hours to signal to the network the vouch ended on poor terms.
```

So we have only `24 hours` left after a vouch was unvouched.
Now if the contract was `pasued` for this `24 hours` then the time limit to mark unhealthy will passed and make imposible to mark the vouch as `unhealthy`, which I show on the `Impact` section of the report.

So now it is 100% proven that `whenNotPaused` modifier is causing this issue.

### Mitigation

Remove `whenNotPaused` modifier from those functions

```diff
  /**
   * @dev Marks vouch as unhealthy.
   * @param vouchId Vouch Id.
   */
-  function markUnhealthy(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused {
+   function markUnhealthy(uint256 vouchId) public {
    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
    uint256 profileId = IEthosProfile(
      contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
    ).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);
    
   ...OTHER_CODES...
}
```

```diff
  /**
   * @dev Convenience function that combines unvouch and mark unhealthy to avoid multiple transactions.
   * @param vouchId Vouch Id.
   */
-  function unvouchUnhealthy(uint256 vouchId) external whenNotPaused {
+ function unvouchUnhealthy(uint256 vouchId) external {
    unvouch(vouchId);
    markUnhealthy(vouchId);
  }
```

#### * Also the [EthosVouch::unvouch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L452) should not have `whenNotPaused` modifier, which is a totally different kind of problem that I described in my another report on this contest.
