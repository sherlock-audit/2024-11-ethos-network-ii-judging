# MAX_TOTAL_FEES is hardcoded to 10,000 bps

### Summary

The MAX_TOTAL_FEES total fees is hardcoded to 10000 bps which implies that the user will be charged 100% of their funds for fees which which lead to loss for user

This appears as a mistake by the protocol dev as it is stated in the [Readme](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii-Smacaud/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#q-are-there-any-limitations-on-values-set-by-admins-or-other-roles-in-the-codebase-including-restrictions-on-array-lengths) that the MAX_TOTAL_FEES should be set at 10% which in this case should be 1000 bps
