# Market Funds Incorrectly Include Protocol and Donation Fees Leading to Fail Withdrawal Graduated Market Funds

### Summary

Incorrect market funds tracking in buyVotes will cause withdrawals to revert in graduated markets as marketFunds includes fees that were already distributed, leading to attempted withdrawals of more funds than available in the contract.

### Root Cause

In ReputationMarket.sol, the [buyVotes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442) function incorrectly tracks total funds by including fees that are immediately distributed:
```solidity
function buyVotes(...) {
    (
        uint256 votesBought,
        uint256 fundsPaid,      // This includes fees + donation !
        ,
        uint256 protocolFee,    // This is sent to protocol
        uint256 donation,       // This goes to rewards
        ...
    ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);

    // Fees are distributed
    applyFees(protocolFee, donation, profileId);

    // But full fundsPaid (including distributed fees) is tracked
    marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
}
```

this is because the `fundsPaid` returned by [_calculateBuy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L978) includes protocolFee and donations

```solidity
function _calculateBuy(...) returns (...) {
    // Calculate votes and prices
    while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
        fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
        fundsPaid += votePrice;
        votesBought++;
    }

    // Incorrectly add fees and donation to fundsPaid
@>  fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;  // @audit This is the root issue
    return (votesBought, fundsPaid, ...);
}
```

The key issue is that _calculateBuy adds the fees to fundsPaid even though these fees don't stay in the market (they're distributed immediately in [applyFees(protocolFee, donation, profileId)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1116-L1127)). Then marketFunds tracks this inflated amount causing withdrawals to attempt to withdraw more funds than actually available.

Looking at [withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L660-L678)

```solidity
function withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(uint256 profileId) public whenNotPaused {
    // Only allowed after graduation
    if (!graduatedMarkets[profileId]) {
        revert MarketNotGraduated();
    }
    if (marketFunds[profileId] == 0) {
        revert InsufficientFunds();
    }

    // Contract has actual_balance = recorded_funds + initial_liquidity - fees_already_distributed - potential claim of donation
    // But tries to withdraw recorded_funds (too high)
    _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]);  // Will revert here due to insufficient funds

    emit MarketFundsWithdrawn(profileId, msg.sender, marketFunds[profileId]);
    marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
}
```


### Internal pre-conditions

1. Market needs to be created with `initialLiquidity` (e.g. 0.02 ETH default config)
2. Protocol fee and donation fee need to be set (combined > 0)
3. Market needs to be graduated using authorized address to enable withdrawal
4. Amount of funds sent out as fees (protocol + donation) must be greater than `initialLiquidity` for withdrawal to fail:
   - Example: If initial liquidity is 0.02 ETH
   - Then user must buy enough votes so that fees distributed (protocol fee + donation) exceed 0.02 ETH
   - With 5% total fees (3% protocol + 2% donation), would need purchase amount > 0.4 ETH to generate 0.02 ETH in fees
5. `marketFunds` tracking incorrectly includes distributed fees
6. Contract must lack sufficient balance to fulfill withdrawal attempt of full tracked amount

This setup ensures that the amount of fees distributed (and thus missing from contract balance) is significant enough that when withdrawal is attempted for the full tracked amount (which incorrectly includes these fees), the contract won't have sufficient balance to fulfill the request.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

When a market is graduated, withdrawal of funds will fail because marketFunds tracks more ETH than actually available in the contract, as fees were already distributed. This breaks the graduation mechanism and could permanently lock funds.
It will also try to send the funds that the owner of the market haven't claim yet as donation.

### PoC

Include this test in rep.graduate.test.ts inside the describe test suit of `Market Funds Tracking`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/test/reputationMarket/rep.graduate.test.ts#L172-L251

Compile and test:
1. git clone
2. cd ethos && npm ci
3. cd packages/contracts

`npm run test:contracts`  To run all the tests including the POC

`NODE_OPTIONS='--no-warnings=ExperimentalWarning --experimental-loader ts-node/esm/transpile-only' npx hardhat test --grep "should revert withdrawal due to incorrect funds tracking including fees”`
To run the specific poc

```typescript
  it("should revert withdrawal due to incorrect funds tracking including fees", async () => {
    // Add a describe block at start to print what we're testing
    console.log("\n=== Testing Incorrect Funds Tracking ===");
    
    // Log initial state
    const initialFunds = await reputationMarket.marketFunds(DEFAULT.profileId);
    console.log(`Initial market funds: ${ethers.formatEther(initialFunds)} ETH`);

    // Set protocol fee address first
    await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setProtocolFeeAddress(deployer.ADMIN.address);
    console.log("✓ Protocol fee address set");

    // Set fees
    await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints(300);
    console.log("✓ Entry protocol fee set to 3%");
    await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setDonationBasisPoints(200);
    console.log("✓ Donation fee set to 2%");
    
    const buyAmount = ethers.parseEther("1");
    await userA.buyVotes({ buyAmount });
    console.log(`✓ Bought votes with ${ethers.formatEther(buyAmount)} ETH`);

    // Log tracked funds after purchase
    const trackedFunds = await reputationMarket.marketFunds(DEFAULT.profileId);
    console.log(`Current market funds: ${ethers.formatEther(trackedFunds)} ETH`);

    // Graduate and attempt withdrawal
    await reputationMarket.connect(graduator).graduateMarket(DEFAULT.profileId);
    console.log("✓ Market graduated");
    
    console.log("Attempting withdrawal (should fail)...");
    await expect(
        reputationMarket.connect(graduator).withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(DEFAULT.profileId)
    ).to.be.reverted;
});
```



### Mitigation

Track only actual market funds by subtracting fees:
```solidity
function buyVotes(...) {
    (
        uint256 votesBought,
        uint256 fundsPaid,
        ,
        uint256 protocolFee,
        uint256 donation,
        ...
    ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);

    applyFees(protocolFee, donation, profileId);

    // Track only actual funds (excluding distributed fees)
    marketFunds[profileId] += (fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation);
```
