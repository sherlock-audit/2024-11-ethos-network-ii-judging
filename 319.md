# Wrong calculation of entry fees leads to overpayment of fees

### Summary

Wrong calculation of protocol fees and donations in `buyVotes()` function leads to overpayment of fees for user calling this function.

### Root Cause

[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1145-L1147)
Entry fees are calculated based on amount provided in `previewFees()`:
```solidity
    if (isEntry) {
      protocolFee = (amount * entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;
      donation = (amount * donationBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;
```
The issue is that amount is `msg.value`,  not the price of the votes bought by the user:
```solidity
 ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);
```
For example, in `_calculateSell()` fees are calculated after the function calculates votes price - and fees are always N% of the price.
But due to dynamic nature of vote prices, user will provide too big `msg.value`, and if votes price is smaller than ETH sent, user receives refund.

Even if refund = 0, fees anyway will be bigger than should,  because `msg.value` >= votes price + entry fees. Users cannot avoid overpaying of entry fees by providing "correct" `msg.value`, because there is internal check in `_calculateBuy()`.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

- Amelie wants to buy 100 votes and calls `buyVotes()`, `msg.value` = 100 ETH;
- Votes price = 50 ETH, but fees are calculated based on `msg.value` and = 10 ETH (assume `protocolFee` = 5% and `donation` = 5%), which is 20% of the amount Amelie paid, not 10% as expected in README;
- Amelie pays 60 ETH, refund = 40 ETH.

But if fees were calculated based on votes price (like in `sellVotes()`), then Amelie would pay 55 ETH (5 ETH = 10% of votes price).

### Impact

Users will always overpay entry fees.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Calculate entry fees in the end of `_calculateBuy()` based on votes price.
