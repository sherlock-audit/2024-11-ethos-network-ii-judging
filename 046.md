# Function _createMarket is not payable and it use msg.value

### Summary

The function _createMarket() is not payable function. In the function, it use msg.value to compare with initialLiquidityRequired. 

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L315-L350

The function is not a payable function, the usage of msg.value is not allowed in the function. And also the comparision between msg.value and initialLiquidtyRequired is meaningless. The function will not work as expected due to this issue. To fix it, better claim a variable to bring msg.value from the function which called funtion _createMarket to function _createMarket.
