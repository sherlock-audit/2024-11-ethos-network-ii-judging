# The bonding curve logic is flawed and allows for full drain of funds

### Summary
Ideally, to create fair price for the TRUST and DISTRUST votes, protocol should work with a bonding curve logic. However, their current implementation is not a valid bonding curve and allows for any user to fully drain the contract 

```solidity
  function _calcVotePrice(Market memory market, bool isPositive) private pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalVotes = market.votes[TRUST] + market.votes[DISTRUST];
    return (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] * market.basePrice) / totalVotes;
  }
```

For the bonding curve to be correct, an invariant which must hold true at all times is that any combination of votes bought (or sold) must cost the exact same amount, disregarding of the order they're bought (or sold) in. 

This invariant does not hold true with the currently used formula and therefore allows for drain of funds as any user can just purchase votes for cheap and sell them more expensively.

### Root Cause
Wrong bonding curve logic.


### Attack Path
1. Imagine a market where there's only 1 vote TRUST and 1 vote DISTRUST. Base price is 1 eth.
2. User buys 5 votes in the following order T-D-T-T-T. The price for them is `0.5 + 0.33 + 0.5 + 0.6 + 0.66 = 2.59`
3. The user then sells them in the following order D-T-T-T-T. The price they receive back is `0.16 + 0.8 + 0.75 + 0.66 + 0.5 = 2.87`
4. The user is at an instant profit and can repeat the attack endlessly until the drain the whole contract

### Impact
Loss of funds

### Mitigation
Consider using the usual `x * y = k` formula
