# ReputationMarket.sol :: sellVotes() lacks slippage protection, which can result in users losing funds.

### Summary

`sellVotes()` is used to sell votes for a specific `profileId`. The issue is that it lacks slippage protection, which could result in the user receiving fewer funds than they had initially calculated.

### Root Cause

`sellVotes()` uses the [_calculateSell()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1003-L1045) to determine the amount of funds the user will receive for selling their votes.
```solidity
function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // calculate the amount of votes to sell and the funds received
    (
      uint256 votesSold,
      uint256 fundsReceived,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);

    // update the market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;

    // apply protocol fees
    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

    // send the proceeds to the seller
    _sendEth(fundsReceived);
    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
    emit VotesSold(
      profileId,
      msg.sender,
      isPositive,
      votesSold,
      fundsReceived,
      block.timestamp,
      minVotePrice,
      maxVotePrice
    );
    _emitMarketUpdate(profileId);
  }
```
As you can see, no slippage protection has been implemented. To determine the price of the votes, the code relies on `_calcVotePrice()`.
```solidity
function _calcVotePrice(Market memory market, bool isPositive) private pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalVotes = market.votes[TRUST] + market.votes[DISTRUST];
    return (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] * market.basePrice) / totalVotes;
  }
```
As you can see, the price of votes increases as more votes of a certain type are accumulated. Knowing this, Alice can use `simulateSell()` to estimate how much she would receive from selling her votes. 

If Alice finds the amount satisfactory, she proceeds to call `sellVotes()`. However, Bob notices her transaction and frontruns it by selling his votes first at the higher price. As a result, when Alice's transaction is executed, the price of the votes has decreased due to Bob's actions, causing Alice to receive fewer funds than expected and incur a loss.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User1 intends to sell their votes.  
2. User2 notices the transaction and frontruns it by selling their votes first at a higher price.  
3. When User1's transaction is executed, the vote price has dropped, resulting in User1 receiving fewer funds and incurring a loss.  

### Impact

Sellers can be frontrun, resulting in them receiving fewer funds than expected.

### PoC

To better understand the issue, let's look at an example. For simplicity, assume there are no fees (**fees = 0**) and `profileId = 1`:  

- **Vote price:** 0.01 Ether  
- **Total votes:** 30  
- **TRUST votes:** 25  
- **DISTRUST votes:** 5  
- **Alice's TRUST votes:** 3  
- **Bob's TRUST votes:** 3  

1. Alice calls `simulateSell()` to estimate the funds she will receive for selling her 3 votes. The calculation uses the following formula: `fundsReceived = (votes * price) / totalVotes`.

This requires recalculating the price dynamically for each iteration as the number of votes decreases.

- `price1 = 24 * 0.01 / 29 = 0.24 / 29 = 0.00828 ether` (24 is used because the price is calculated by subtracting 1 before the calcualtion, see [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1036))
- `price2 = 23 * 0.01 / 28 = 0.23 / 28 = 0.00821 ether`
- `price3 = 22 * 0.01 / 27 = 0.22 / 27 = 0.00815 ether`

`fundsReceived = price1 + pirce2 + price 3 = 0.00828 + 0.00821 + 0.00815 = 0.02464 ether`

2. Alice proceeds to call `sellVotes()` expecting to receive **0.02464 ether**.

3. Bob observes Alice's transaction and frontruns it by selling his 3 votes first. Since the vote price remains unchanged at the time of Bob's transaction, Bob receives **0.02464 ether**.

4. After Bob's transaction, the number of **TRUST votes** is reduced from **25** to **22**. When Alice's transaction is executed, the prices for her votes are recalculated based on the reduced pool:

- `price1 = 21 * 0.01 / 26 = 0.21 / 26 = 0.00808 ether` 
- `price2 = 20 * 0.01 / 25 = 0.2 / 25 = 0.00800 ether`
- `price3 = 19 * 0.01 / 24 = 0.19 / 24 = 0.00792 ether`

`fundsReceived = price1 + pirce2 + price 3 = 0.00808 + 0.00800 + 0.00792 = 0.02400 ether`

5. Due to Bob's frontrunning, Alice receives fewer funds than expected:  

- `Loss = 0.02464 âˆ’ 0.02400 = 0.00064 ether`
- `Percentage Loss = 2.6%`





### Mitigation

To resolve the issue, add a slippage parameter to the `sellVotes()`, allowing users to specify their desired slippage tolerance.
