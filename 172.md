# User Unable to Vouch for a Profile or Increase Vouch Balance Due to Potential DoS


## Description

**Context:**

Users [vouch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L330-L415) for profiles to signal trustworthiness to others. In return, [vouchers receive fees as reward](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L697-L739), whenever a new user vouches for the same profile.

Vouchers cannot vouch for the same profile twice, but they can [increase the balance of their vouch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426-L444) if desired. When they do, previous vouchers are rewarded with a fee, similar to when a user vouches for a profile.

It is important to note that the maximum number of vouches a profile can receive is [256](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L287).

**Vulnerability Details:**

As explained, whenever a user vouches or increases their vouch balance, previous vouchers of the profile are rewarded through the `_rewardPreviousVouchers()` function.

This function uses two for loops:

- The [first loop](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L705-L717) iterates through each vouch to track the total balance of active vouches that have not been unvouched.

- The [second loop](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L720-L731) distributes rewards to each voucher.
  
This implementation incurs significant gas costs because:

- It involves iterating through a potentially large number of vouches (up to 2 * 256 iterations due to two for loops).
  
- It performs expensive read/write operations many times in storage.
  
This could result in a transaction reverting due to exceeding the block gas limit, especially when the profile being vouched for, already has a large number of associated vouches (e.g., near the maximum limit, which is 256 vouches).


## Impact

**Damage:** Medium

**Likelihood:** Medium

**Details:** Users will be unable to vouch for a profile that already has many associated vouches. Additionally, users who have already vouched for a profile and want to increase their vouch balance by depositing more ETH, to indicate they have gained more trust in the profile, will also fail to do so.

## Proof of Concept

**Attack Path:**

1. Suppose there is a profile with `250` vouchers associated with it.
2. A new user attempts to vouch for this profile by calling the `vouchByProfileId()` function. Inside this function, the internal [applyFees()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L929-L965) function is triggered, which handles fee distribution to the protocol, vouchee, and previous vouchers of the profile being vouched for.
3. The `applyFees()` function internally calls `_rewardPreviousVouchers()` function, to reward all previous vouchers of the profile.
4. Due to the large number of iterations (2 * 250 times, since there are two for loops) and the read/write operations being performed on storage, the transaction exceeds the gas limit, causing the `vouchByProfileId()` function call to revert and the user being unable to vouch for the desired profile.

**POC:**

- Not Needed

## Recommended Mitigation

The mechanism for rewarding previous vouchers of a profile should be completely redesigned.

My recommendation would be:

- Track the total accumulated fees (collected when users vouch or increase their vouch balance) in a separate state variable.
  
- Implement a time-based rewards system where vouchers who have supported the profile (by vouching) for a longer duration compared to others, receive a larger portion of the total accumulated fees. Newer vouchers, or those for whom not much time has passed since the time they initiated to vouch, receive a smaller portion of the total fees.
