# Market Funds Accounting Problem in ReputationMarket.sol

### Summary

The ReputationMarket.sol `buyVotes` function incorrectly tallies market funds by including protocol fees and donations in marketFunds[profileId], leading to inflated balances, adding to this when combined with the `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` function, this creates a vulnerability allowing withdrawal of funds from other markets or locking the funds in the contract.

### Root Cause

The contract adds the full `fundsPaid` amount (including fees) to marketFunds[profileId]https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481 
even though before this the -
Protocol fees is sent to protocolFeeAddress
Donations are moved to donationEscrow
So when a market is graduated and function `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` is called https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L660
it withdraws amounts that exceed actual market holdings or lock the funds in the contract if there isnt enough liquidity

### Attack Path

an example of this problem can be - lets  assume there are 2 markets
Market A  actual marketfunds value should be 5 ETH
Due to fee accounting issue, Market A shows: 5.5 ETH (0.5 ETH from fees) {note- this is just an example fee can differ but it will always add more funds to the mapping then it should as its always `marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;`}
Market b value: 3 ETH
Market A graduates
withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(marketA) is called
Contract attempts to send 5.5 ETH
Takes 5 ETH from Market A and extra 0.5 ETH from Market B (it can take from the donations reserved for the market owners too but the impact is similar as its always withdrawing more) -loss of 0.5 eth 
this is a particular example so basically -
While using the withdraw graduatedMarketFunds function it will try to withdraw more than the actual balance of the market funds which can either revert(if not enough liquidity) and lock the funds in or withdraw more funds (like the above example)

### Impact

Inflated market fund balances that leads to the contract believe it has more available funds than it actaully does that leads to-
Cross-market fund drainage(will happen during withdrawals)
Can revert(if not enough liquidity) and lock funds in the contract
Loss of funds for later withdrawing markets

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
When updating marketfunds only add the actual funds that remain after deducting both protocol fees and donations.
