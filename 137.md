# Reentrancy Issue in updateDonationRecipient Function of ReputationMarket Contract

### Summary

During the analysis of the ReputationMarket smart contract, a reentrancy vulnerability was discovered concerning the updateDonationRecipient function. This vulnerability allows malicious actors to block the update of the donation recipient's address, resulting in funds becoming "stuck" with the existing recipient. This report provides a detailed examination of the nature of the vulnerability, the mechanisms behind its emergence, and the potential consequences.



### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L544-L564

```solidity
function updateDonationRecipient(uint256 profileId, address newRecipient) public whenNotPaused {  
    if (newRecipient == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();  
    // Check the balance of the new recipient  
    require(donationEscrow[newRecipient] == 0, "Donation recipient has balance");  
    ...  
}  
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. An attacker creates a malicious contract that can call the updateDonationRecipient function.

2. When attempting to update the donation recipient's address, the function checks the balance and rejects the operation if it's not zero.

3. As a result, donations continue to go to the old address, and users cannot retrieve their funds.

### Mitigation

```solidity
function updateDonationRecipient(uint256 profileId, address newRecipient) public whenNotPaused {  
        if (newRecipient == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();  
  
        // Logic to safely update the donation recipient  
        address oldRecipient = getCurrentDonationRecipient(profileId);  
          
        // Transfer donations if necessary  
        if (donationEscrow[oldRecipient] > 0) {  
            // Logic to handle the transfer of donations  
        }  
  
        donationEscrow[newRecipient] = 0; // Reset the balance of the new recipient  
        emit DonationRecipientUpdated(profileId, newRecipient);  
    }
