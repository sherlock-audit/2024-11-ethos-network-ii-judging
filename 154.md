# Method sellVotes() doesn't have slippage protection

### Summary

The method `sellVotes()` in `ReputationMarket.sol` doesn't support any slippage protection. Which makes it vulnerable to frontrunning or sandwich attacks in L1 and still impact users if some transaction on same profileId executes before them. Which is possible in a protocol with high TVL.

### Root Cause

In `https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495C3-L534C4` there is not slippage protection.
```solidity
  function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
  ```


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice sends sellVotes() transaction to the mempool.
2. Bob sandwich user's txn and first sellVotes() and then buyVotes() or Bob simply sells their votes by the time Alice sent her transaction. Which leads to Alice getting less amount than estimated for selling votes.

### Impact

The loss of funds of the user.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a minimum received in the `sellVotes()` method and revert the call if the calculated amount is less than minimum received.
