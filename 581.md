# Inclusion of fees in `marketFunds` leads to insolvent market operations

### Summary

In the `MarketReputation` contract, fees for market operations (protocol and donation fees) are accounted for as part of the `marketFunds`. However, these fees are transferred out during the `buyVotes` operation (protocol fees are sent immediately, and donation fees are escrowed). This creates a mismatch between the marketFunds balance and the actual ETH liquidity available for market operations. This inconsistency can lead to insolvency during other operations like `sellVotes` or fund withdrawals for graduated markets.

Therefore, improper handling of funds within `ReputationMarket`’s vote trading logic causes insolvency across markets, preventing proper operation and graduation of these markets. This results in a cascading failure as `ReputationMarket`’s design fails to account for cases where user transactions deplete the market’s balance below liabilities.

### Root Cause

  - In the `buyVotes` function:
    - Fees (`protocolFee` and `donation`) are calculated ([here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L960)) and then processed via `applyFees` (see [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L464)), which transfers protocol fees to `protocolFeeAddress` and updates `donationEscrow`.
    - Despite this, the total fees are added to `fundsPaid` ([here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L978)) and subsequently to the `marketFunds` mapping ([here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481)).

  - In subsequent operations (`sellVotes` and `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds`), `marketFunds` is relied upon to determine available funds, leading to incorrect assumptions about solvency.

### Internal pre-conditions

  1.	Admin needs to configure protocol fees and donation fee, setting up the vulnerable state.
  2.	Users buy votes, causing a mismatch between market liabilities and the contract’s available funds.
  3.	(optional) Users withdraw donations, reducing the available funds further.
  4.	(optional) Admin calls `graduateMarket()`, which exacerbates insolvency by redistributing funds from the insolvent market.

### External pre-conditions

No conditions

### Attack Path

  1.	A user calls `buyVotes()` on a profile, depleting funds in `ReputationMarket` without verifying solvency.
  2.	The user calls `withdrawDonations()` to remove additional funds from the contract, leaving the market insolvent.
  3.	Admin calls `graduateMarket()` for the insolvent profile, triggering cascading insolvency in connected markets:
    -    Remaining markets cannot graduate (`graduateMarket()` reverts).
    -    Users cannot sell votes in connected markets due to insufficient funds (`sellVotes()` reverts).
  4.	Attempts to withdraw funds post-graduation (`withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()`) result in ETH transfer failures.

### Impact

  -	Affected Party: `ReputationMarket` users, including vote buyers, sellers, and market participants.
  -	Loss: Users cannot perform basic actions like selling votes or withdrawing market funds, effectively locking their assets.
  -	Systemic Risk: Cascading insolvency across markets disrupts the protocol’s trust model.


### PoC

The provided PoC demonstrates the issue through Hardhat tests, validating insolvency scenarios. Key points:
  1. Users create markets and execute actions (buy votes, withdraw donations).
  2. Fund balances and liabilities are checked, showing mismatches after operations.
  3. Admin attempts to graduate and withdraw funds from insolvent markets, leading to reverts or systemic failures.

```

### Mitigation


Exclude Fees from `marketFunds`, modify `buyVotes` to exclude protocolFee and donation from marketFunds:

```solidity
marketFunds[profileId] += (fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation);
```
