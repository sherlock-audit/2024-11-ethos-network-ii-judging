# Unable to mark unvouch as unhealthy due to faulty update of parameters

### Summary

Updating the `unhealthyResponsePeriod` alters the timeframe during which previous calls to unvouch can mark a service as unhealthy. A likely scenario is that a user who has unvouched may find themselves unable to mark the service as unhealthy because the `unhealthyResponsePeriod` has been reduced, thereby shortening the time available to them since they initially unvouched.

### Root Cause

In [EthosVouch:662](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L662) the `unhealthyReposnePeriod` is updated. When `markUnHealthy()` we check that this amount of time has not passed in [EthosVouch:858](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L858)

```solidity
bool stillHasTime = block.timestamp <=
v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt + unhealthyResponsePeriod;
```

updating this parameters thus changes the amount of time available to call `markUnhealthy()` even for previously unvouched calls.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A Bob unvouches. Time to call `markUnhealthy()` is `unhealthyReposnePeriod_1`
2. Admin calls `updateUnhealthyResponsePeriod()` such that `unhealthyReposnePeriod=unhealthyReposnePeriod_2 <unhealthyReposnePeriod_1`
3. Bob calls `MarkUnhealthy()` at after `t` seconds where `unhealthyReposnePeriod_2<t<unhealthyReposnePeriod_1`
4. The call reverts
