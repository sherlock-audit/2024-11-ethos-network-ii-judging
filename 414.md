# Incorrect exclusion of Fees in Market Funds Calculation in `ReputationMarket::sellVotes()`

### Summary

The exitFee is incorrectly excluded in [ReputationMarket::sellVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495) when finished calculating the votes to sell in `ReputationMarket::_calculateSell()`.

when `ReputationMarket::_calculateSell()` is called in `ReputationMarket::sellVotes()` to calculate the votes to sell and return the selling parameters, it takes the amount of votes(whether trust or distrust) to sell in a market.
After selling the votes, it preview fees for the returns gotten from selling the votes, the fee applied here is the `exitFee`
```solidity
(fundsReceived, protocolFee, ) = previewFees(fundsReceived, false);
```
`previewFees(fundsReceived, false);`previewFees minus the fee percentage from `fundsReceived`(returns from selling the votes) and overwrite it to return `fundsReceived = fundsReceived - fees`
Then in `ReputationMarket::sellVotes()`
```solidity
  function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);
    // calculate the amount of votes to sell and the funds received
 (uint256 votesSold, uint256 fundsReceived, ,uint256 protocolFee, uint256 minVotePrice, uint256 maxVotePrice) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);

    // update the market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;

    // apply protocol fees
    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

    // send the proceeds to the seller
    _sendEth(fundsReceived);
    // tally market funds
    // incorrectly
    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
   ...
  }
```
`marketFunds[profileId]` is incorrectly set to fundsReceived which is `total returns - exitFee`
Which is incorrect cause exitFee was paid based on the user total returns and should be removed from the marketFunds



### Root Cause

in `ReputationMarkets::_calculateSell()`
```solidity
    while (votesSold < amount) {
      if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
        revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
      }

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
      fundsReceived += votePrice;
      votesSold++;
    }
  @>> (fundsReceived, protocolFee, ) = previewFees(fundsReceived, false);
    minPrice = votePrice;
```
previewFees returned the fundsReceived = fundsReceived - protocolFee (assume fundsReceived before fees = 100eth, protocolFee = 2eth => 100 - 2 = 98eth after fees)

in `ReputationMarkets::sellVotes()`
```solidity
marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
```
what ends up being subtracted from the marketFunds is 98eth meaning there will still be 2eth left in the marketFunds which the contract(protocol) doesnt have sufficient funds to cover.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Protocol fees and donation fees are set

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. UserA call to sell all trust votes, the amount to receive is 100eth but 2eth get subtracted for fees (200 in BP) leaving what is received to be 98eth, 98eth is removed from the market funds leaving what is left in the market funds to be 2eth, with no current holder of votes and an initialLiquidity balance in contract.

### Impact

Contract can face insolvency cause it doesnt account for fees, This can break the invariant `The vouch and vault contracts must never revert a transaction due to running out of funds.`, Even when there are no holders of votes (Market is in default state) market funds appear larger than what the balance is in the contract.

### PoC

add this to `rep.market.test.ts` and run the test
```solidity
it('should remove fees from fundsReceived and revert on withdrawal of over-allocated marketFunds', async () => {
    //setup contract
    const entryFee = 200;
    const exitFee = 300;
    const donationFee = 100;
    const protocolFeeAddress = ethers.Wallet.createRandom().address;
    await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setProtocolFeeAddress(protocolFeeAddress);
    await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints(entryFee);
    await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setDonationBasisPoints(donationFee);
    await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setExitProtocolFeeBasisPoints(exitFee);

    );

    const balanceBeforeBuyVotes = await ethers.provider.getBalance(
      await reputationMarket.getAddress(),
    );
    console.log(
      'Reputation Market Balance Before Buy Votes',
      balanceBeforeBuyVotes,
      ethers.formatEther(balanceBeforeBuyVotes) + 'eth',
    );
    //buy votes that would later be sold so the protocol can get fees
    const { trustVotes: buyvotes, fundsPaid: buyfundspaid } = await userA.buyVotes({
      profileId: DEFAULT.profileId,
      buyAmount: ethers.parseEther('100'),
    });
    //withdraw donations as market owner when votes are purchased
    await reputationMarket.connect(userA.signer).withdrawDonations();
    console.log('Bought Trust Votes', buyvotes);
    console.log('Funds Paid By userA ', buyfundspaid, ethers.formatEther(buyfundspaid!) + 'eth');
    const MarketFundsAfterBuy = await reputationMarket.marketFunds(DEFAULT.profileId);
    console.log(
      'Market Funds After Buy Votes',
      MarketFundsAfterBuy,
      ethers.formatEther(MarketFundsAfterBuy) + 'eth',
    );
    //balance of contract after userA purchased votes
    const balanceAfterBuyVotes = await ethers.provider.getBalance(
      await reputationMarket.getAddress(),
    );
    console.log(
      'Reputation Market Balance After Buy Votes',
      balanceAfterBuyVotes,
      ethers.formatEther(balanceAfterBuyVotes) + 'eth',
    );
    //userA sold all votes, taking all their funds from the contract but leavinf fees in marketFunds
    const { fundsReceived: sellFundsRecieved } = await userA.sellVotes({
      profileId: DEFAULT.profileId,
      sellVotes: buyvotes,
    });
    //The funds recieved is less due to fees
    console.log(
      'Sell Funds Gotten From Selling All Votes ',
      sellFundsRecieved,
      ethers.formatEther(sellFundsRecieved!) + 'eth',
    );
    //balance of contract after userA sold all votes
    const ReputationMarketbalanceAfterSellVotes = await ethers.provider.getBalance(
      await reputationMarket.getAddress(),
    );
    //we can see the initital liquidty in the contract
    console.log(
      'Reputation Market Balance After Sell Votes',
      ReputationMarketbalanceAfterSellVotes,
      ethers.formatEther(ReputationMarketbalanceAfterSellVotes) + 'eth',

    const finalMarketFundsAfterSell = await reputationMarket.marketFunds(DEFAULT.profileId);
    console.log(
      'Market Funds After Sell Votes',
      finalMarketFundsAfterSell,
      ethers.formatEther(finalMarketFundsAfterSell) + 'eth',
    );

    await deployer.contractAddressManager.contract
      .connect(deployer.OWNER)
      .updateContractAddressesForNames([deployer.ADMIN.address], ['GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL']);
    const graduator = deployer.ADMIN;
    await reputationMarket.connect(graduator).graduateMarket(DEFAULT.profileId);

    expect(ReputationMarketbalanceAfterSellVotes).to.be.lessThan(finalMarketFundsAfterSell);
    // Cannot process sending market funds to graduator cause the contract doesnt have sufficient funds
    await expect(
      reputationMarket.connect(graduator).withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(DEFAULT.profileId),
    ).to.be.revertedWith('ETH transfer failed');
  });

### Mitigation

before `marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;` add protocol fees to `fundsReceived` so it would be subtracted too
