# Duplicate parameters can cause a complicated issue

### Summary

In `Reputation.sol`, the use of public variables from another contract can lead to storage conflicts, potentially causing crashes.

### Root Cause

In [Reputation.sol::L211,L212](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L211C6-L212C25), the function `initialize` utilizes `expectedSigner` and `signatureVerifier` to initialize access control. These two variables are declared as public in [SignatureControl.sol::L12,L13](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/SignatureControl.sol#L12C3-L13C36).

```solidity
contract ReputationMarket is AccessControl, UUPSUpgradeable, ReentrancyGuard {
    function initialize(
        address owner,
        address admin,
        address expectedSigner,
        address signatureVerifier,
        address contractAddressManagerAddr
    ) external initializer {
        __accessControl_init(
            owner,
            admin,
            expectedSigner,                       //@audit-issue this variable is declared as public in SignatureControl.sol
            signatureVerifier,                    //@audit-issue this variable is declared as public in SignatureControl.sol
            contractAddressManagerAddr
        );
        ...
    }
}
```

```solidity
abstract contract SignatureControl is Initializable {
    address public expectedSigner;
    address public signatureVerifier;
    ...
}
```

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The presence of duplicate parameters and public variables can lead to storage collisions, resulting in potential infinite recursion. This situation may ultimately cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

### Proof of Concept

_No response_

### Mitigation

To resolve this issue, the `initialize` function in `Reputation.sol` should be modified to use distinct parameter names, as follows:

```solidity
function initialize(
    address _owner,
    address _admin,
    address _expectedSigner,
    address _signatureVerifier,
    address _contractAddressManagerAddr
) external initializer {
    __accessControl_init(
        _owner,
        _admin,
        _expectedSigner,                       
        _signatureVerifier,                   
        _contractAddressManagerAddr
    );
    ...
}
```
