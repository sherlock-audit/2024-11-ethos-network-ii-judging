# Users can call `EthosVouch::increaseVouch` function when the protocol is paused

### Summary

When the `EthosVouch` contract is paused the user should not be able to perform any actions and to change the contract's state. But the users can call `increaseVouch` function because the function doesn't have `whenNotPaused` modifier.

### Root Cause

The `EthosVouch` contract can be paused and almost all functions that change the contract's states have `whenNotPaused` modifier. But the function [`increaseVouch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426) doesn't have `whenNotPaused` modifier:

```solidity

@> function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable nonReentrant {
    ...
   }

```
Therefore the function allows the users to increase the amount of a given vouch and change the state of the contract when it is paused.
