# No slippage protection in `sellVotes` function can lead to loss of funds for the seller.

### Summary

`sellVotes` function is used to sell votes bought by the users. The user specifies the amount of the votes he wishes to sell but he is unable to provide the expected minimum price for these votes. This will lead to scenarios where users receive less ether than expected when their transaction gets placed after other sales. Due to the fact that user would receive worse price after the transaction, he might have decided not to sell with the current market condition and sell the votes for a better price later.

Missing slippage protection leads to loss of funds when user's transaction gets placed after other sales. The seller will not receive expected payment for the sold votes.

### Root Cause

The `sellVotes` function does not have slippage protection implemented.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User needs to buy votes in `ReputationMarket`

### External pre-conditions

1. 3 other users decide to sell votes
2. The user decides to sell thinking he will get the expected price for the votes, however the 3 other transaction will be executed before his and the ether amount that the user receives will be much smaller

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The user will lose ether after selling votes. It is important to note that it is not a front-running issue but transaction ordering issue. Depending on how the transactions are ordered the result of the transaction is different.

### PoC

The `sellVotes` function does not have slippage protection implemented. Please look at root cause and external pre-conditions.

### Mitigation

Add slippage protection to `sellVotes` function.
