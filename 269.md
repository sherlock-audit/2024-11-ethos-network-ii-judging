# Lack of slippage protection in `sellVotes` function

### Summary

- There is no slippage in `sellVotes` function. When a user wants to sell his votes, user will give the amount of votes which he wants to sell as parameter. This votes will be sold at current price of votes by changing price after each vote sell.
- When you see `buyVotes` function, there is a slippage parameter which protects user from loss due to slippage and user can give minimum votes he wants as a parameter of slippage percentage.
- But in `sellVotes`, there is no protection for the user for loss of funds due to slippage. That means if price changes before the user sell the votes, user will get less price for his votes than expected.
- In `sellVotes` user cannot provide any kind of slippage which gives them protection from slippage.
