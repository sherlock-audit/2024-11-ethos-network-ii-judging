# Max Total Fee is set higher than expected

### Summary

The max total fee in `EthoVouch.sol` is larger than 10% of the deposit which violate the invariant

### Root Cause

In `EthoVouch.sol::120`, `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is set to 10000 while the `BASIS_POINT_SCALE` is also 10000 which means the total fee can be up to 100% of the deposit.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

The admin can set the total fee to higher than 10% without noticing that as the `checkFeeExceedsMaximum`  function is not going to revert even if that happened. It results in extra funds being charged to the voucher.

### Mitigation

```diff
  // --- Constants ---
  uint256 private constant ABSOLUTE_MINIMUM_VOUCH_AMOUNT = 0.0001 ether;
-  uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
+  uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000;
  uint256 public constant BASIS_POINT_SCALE = 10000;
