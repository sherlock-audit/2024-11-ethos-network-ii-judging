# Total fees can exceed 10% in `EthosVouch` contract causing users to pay much more fees than assured by the protocol.

### Summary

Protocol specifies that maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%. This invirant can be broken by the protocol and maximum total fees paid by users can exceed 10%.

### Root Cause

In first scenario the protocol does not have any boundries in `initializer` function. The protocol can set up these fees in a way that maximum total fees will exceed 10%.

In second scenario the protocol can use setter functions.

The reason this scenario is possible is that the `checkFeeExceedsMaximum` function checks total fees value against `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` which is set to `10000`. Meaning the maximum total fees can be greater than 10%.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

It's not an attack but a normal usage. Information provided in root cause shows the steps.

### Impact

User can pay bigger fees than assured by the protocol. This unexpected fees will lead to loss of funds for a user.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Bound the fees so that they cannot exceed 10%.
