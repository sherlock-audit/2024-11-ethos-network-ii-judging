# The contract `EthosVouch.sol` has Incorrect Access Control in `setProtocolFeeAddress` Function

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L624
### Summary

This issue is classified as a `Medium Severity` finding due to the potential for direct loss of fees from the protocol.

In the `EthosVouch:624` contract, the function `setProtocolFeeAddress` is currently restricted to the `onlyOwner` role. This design flaw allows only the owner to update the protocol fee address, which can lead to unauthorized manipulation or neglect of administrative responsibilities, resulting in protocol fee mismanagement or loss.

The primary concern is that any party with the owner's privileges might set the fee address inappropriately, leading to loss of protocol fees on high-volume transactions

### Root Cause

In the function `EthosVouch.sol:624` we are change the address of the feeAddress. So this is only be call by `onlyAdmin`. There is wrong Implementation to `onlyOwner`.

```javascript

@>    function setProtocolFeeAddress(address _protocolFeeAddress) external onlyOwner {
    if (_protocolFeeAddress == address(0)) revert InvalidFeeProtocolAddress();
    protocolFeeAddress = _protocolFeeAddress;
    emit ProtocolFeeAddressUpdated(protocolFeeAddress);
  }

```

### Internal pre-conditions

`onlyOwner` is used to guard the `setProtocolFeeAddress` function.

### External pre-conditions

A malicious or negligent owner can manipulate the protocol fee address to their advantage.

### Attack Path

1. The owner (or an entity exploiting the owner's privileges) updates the `setProtocolFeeAddress` to an unintended or malicious address.
2. Protocol fees from transactions are redirected or lost, compromising protocol revenues.

### Impact

There are several impacts to this bug.
1. **Loss of fees:** If the `onlyAdmin` is not Implemented user never have to pay the fee on an transaction and This is heavy loss to the protocol on big transactions.
2. **Loss of trust:** If the user find out that the protocol is not charging the fee on transaction

### PoC

The issue can be identified through a manual review of the `EthosVouch` contract. Changing the `setProtocolFeeAddress` using the `onlyOwner` role demonstrates the vulnerability.

### Mitigation

Replace the `onlyOwner` to `onlyAdmin` can change `setProtocolFeeAddress` function .

```diff

-   function setProtocolFeeAddress(address _protocolFeeAddress) external onlyOwner {
+   function setProtocolFeeAddress(address _protocolFeeAddress) external onlyAdmin {
        if (_protocolFeeAddress == address(0)) revert InvalidFeeProtocolAddress();
        protocolFeeAddress = _protocolFeeAddress;
        emit ProtocolFeeAddressUpdated(protocolFeeAddress);
    }

```
