# Absence of slippage protection in the `sellVotes` function may lead to loss of funds for users

### Summary

Absence of slippage protection in the `sellVotes` function may lead to big loss of funds for users. This is possible due to the way that a price of a vote is calculated in the [`RepMarket::_calcVotePrice`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L920-L923):
```javascript
  function _calcVotePrice(Market memory market, bool isPositive) private pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalVotes = market.votes[TRUST] + market.votes[DISTRUST];
    return (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] * market.basePrice) / totalVotes;
  }
```
This way of calculating the price of a share can lead to loss of funds for the user, since the price can get inflated/deflated from other users buy the same or the counterpart votes. Such slippage mechanism is implemented in `buyVotes` function to prevent the users from getting less votes than they want and should be implemented in `sellVotes` for preventing the users from getting less eth than they want.
