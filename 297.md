# Incorrect value for `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` constant breaks fee limiting functionality

### Summary

`MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is set to 10000 instead of 1000, which is a 100% instead of a 10% for the limit of expected max fees.

### Root Cause

In [EthosVouch.sol::120](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120), the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is set to 10000, instead of 1000. 
From the readme in "Are there any limitations on values set by admins (or other roles) in the codebase, including restrictions on array lengths?" section, it is expected that "Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%" for both contracts.

However, because `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` has an additional 0, the fee checks in basis points will be compared against 100%, not 10%, allowing fees to be higher than 10%.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

Any change from the admin to set new protocol fees will be incorrectly checked against 100%, instead of 10%.

### Impact

Medium. The README explicitly states that _"Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%"_. However, as demonstrated, it can be exceeded.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` to 10% in bps:

```diff
// File: EthosVouch.sol

- uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
+ uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000;
```
