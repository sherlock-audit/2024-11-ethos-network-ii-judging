# Users will not be able to update donation recipient due to redundant require statement

### Summary

ReputationMarket.sol's updateDonationRecipient function won't let users update their recipient address if the new recipient address has a balance, this is redundant and has no use other than blocking users from updating their recipient address.

### Root Cause

Even though the comment states that it should not allow overwriting, it can correctly update the balances, so the requirement only blocks users ability to update recipient address.
