# User will lose ether due to wrong `_calculateSell` function implementation.

### Summary

`_calculateSell` function is used in `sellVotes` function to calculate the current price the user should receive for selling the vote. The issue is that this function does not apply the first (and also the highest) price for the vote into user's account. As a result the user will not receive the expected payment for the votes that he sells.

### Root Cause

We can see that the first price is calculated in `_calculateSell`.

`uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);`

But later it is overriden by anoter calculation. This newly calculated price is smaller because it is calculated when the amount of votes is already decreased by 1. Total votes matter in price calculation. The first calculated price (also the highest) is not added to user's balance.

```solidty
    market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
    votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    fundsReceived += votePrice;
    votesSold++;
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User needs to buy votes
2. Then the user needs to sell the votes

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

User will not receive the expected amount for the votes leading to loss of funds. The first price calculated is a valid price for the sold vote however it will be overriden by new smaller price.

### PoC

Let's assume current state:

TRUST votes = 10
DISTRUST votes = 10
Base price = 0.01 ether

User wants to sell one TRUST vote.

$ {0.01 * 10} \over 20$ $ = 0.005 $

User should receive 0.005 for that vote. In current implementation the user will receive.

$ {0.01 * 9} \over 19$ $ ~= 0.0047 $

The difference is around `6%`.

### Mitigation

First calculate the price and then subtract the vote count.

```solidty
    votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
    fundsReceived += votePrice;
    votesSold++;
```
