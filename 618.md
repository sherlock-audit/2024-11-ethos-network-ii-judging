# # Double Counting of Fees in ReputationMarket Will Lead to Fund Loss

### Summary

The incorrect handling of fees in the `buyVotes()` function will cause a loss of funds for the protocol as the `marketFunds[profileId]` will include both protocol fees and donation fees, leading to double counting.

### Root Cause

In `ReputationMarket.sol`, the line `marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;` incorrectly adds the total funds paid, which includes both protocol fees and donation fees, to the market funds. This results in an inflated `marketFunds` value. [Github Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481)

In `ReputationMarket.sol`, the calculation of `marketFunds[profileId]` does not account for the fact that `fundsPaid` includes protocol fees and donations.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The user needs to call `buyVotes()` and provide funds that include protocol fees and donations.
2. The market must be active and not graduated for the funds to be counted.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol suffers an approximate loss of funds during market graduation. When the market is graduated, the total funds sent to the graduation contract will include the already counted protocol fees and donations, leading to a loss of these funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To fix this issue, the code should be modified to ensure that only the actual market funds (excluding protocol fees and donations) are counted in `marketFunds[profileId]`. This can be done by adjusting the line to:

```solidity
marketFunds[profileId] += (fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation);
```


This change will ensure that the funds tracked in the mapping `marketFunds` accurately reflect only the funds that are meant for the market, preventing any loss during the graduation process.
