# MAX_TOTAL_FEES is set too large and does not meet design expectations, which may result in the user paying more handling fees

### Summary

MAX_TOTAL_FEES is set too large and does not meet design expectations, which may result in the user paying more handling fees. The [document](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/675) says that the maximum fee cannot exceed 10%, which is MAX_TOTAL_FEES/BASIS_POINT_SCALE==10%. And in the code MAX_TOTAL_FEES/BASIS_POINT_SCALE==100%.

### Root Cause

In [EthosVouch.sol#L120-L121](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120-L121), the wrong invariant makes the maximum handling fee higher than expected.
