# Market funds accounting error in buyVotes

### Summary

ReputationMarket's buyVotes function includes fees when tallying market funds, this can lead to a multitude of issues.

### Root Cause

In ReputationMarket.sol's buyVotes function `marketFunds[profileId]` is increased by `fundsPaid`, problem with that is `fundsPaid` also includes protocol and donation fees. Donation fees are stored in DonationEscrow storage variable and protocol fees are sent to the corresponding address. Donation fees can be withdrawn by the market owner any time.

Later when a market graduates, `marketFunds[profileId]` amount is going to be sent to "GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL" contract.

We can observe that this can lead to multiple issues: On market graduation, funds more than necessary will be sent to "GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL" contract which means there might not be enough eth left in the contract for market owner to get earned donations or if donations are withdrawn before graduation("withdrawDonations do not decrease `marketFunds[profileId]`) there might not be enough eth left to graduate market.
