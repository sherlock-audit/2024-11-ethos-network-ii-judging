# Can increase vouch while paused

### Summary

`increaseVouch` is the only user-facing function that lacks `whenNotPaused` modifier.

### Root Cause

In EthosVouch.sol L426 there is a missing `whenNotPaused` modifier:
```solidity
  function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable nonReentrant 
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The user needs to have an active vouch.
2. Admin needs to pause the `EthosVouch` contract.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User A vouches for User B.
2. Admin pauses Vouch contract.
3. User A increases the vouch.

### Impact

The contract is supposed to be paused under critical conditions. Users should not be allowed to invoke functions that accept new monetary value into the contract.

The real impact depends on the reason why the contract was paused but if it is due to serious issues discovered, the protocol should prevent users from interacting until fixes are introduced.

### PoC

```typescript
  it('should not successfully increase vouch amount when paused', async () => {
    const { vouchId, balance } = await userA.vouch(userB, { paymentAmount: initialAmount });

    await deployer.interactionControl.contract
      .connect(deployer.OWNER)
      .pauseContract(smartContractNames.vouch);

    expect(await deployer.ethosVouch.contract.paused()).to.equal(true, 'Should be paused');

    const protocolFeeAmount = calculateFee(increaseAmount, entryFee).fee;
    const donationFeeAmount = calculateFee(increaseAmount, donationFee).fee;
    const expectedDeposit = increaseAmount - protocolFeeAmount - donationFeeAmount;

    await deployer.ethosVouch.contract
      .connect(userA.signer)
      .increaseVouch(vouchId, { value: increaseAmount });

    const finalBalance = await userA.getVouchBalance(vouchId);
    expect(finalBalance).to.be.closeTo(balance + expectedDeposit, 1n);
  });
```

### Mitigation

Add `whenNotPaused` to the `increaseVouch` function.
