# During the user's trust/distrust vote-selling process, the votePrice will be calculated incorrectly in each iteration.

### Summary

During the user's trust/distrust vote-selling process, the `votePrice` will be calculated incorrectly in each iteration.

### Root Cause
 The `votePrice` is taken on first iteration after reducing the 1 trust/distrust vote balance.
```solidity
while (votesSold < amount) {
      if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
        revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
      }

>    market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
>    votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
      fundsReceived += votePrice;
      votesSold++;
    }
 ```   

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

At the beginning of the `_calculateSell` helper function, the maximum vote price is being calculated, but it is not considered during the first iteration.

```solidity
    uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);

    uint256 maxPrice = votePrice;
```

### Impact

For each iteration the 1 trust/distrust vote count will be less to calculate the `votePrice`
Loss of funds for users.

### PoC

1 - The user is going to sell 1000 trust votes.
2 - Let's say that the distrust vote = 1000 and the `market.basePrice` = 0.01 ether , totalVotes = 2000.
3 - The `votePrice` should be calculated with 1000 trust votes but it calculated after reducing with 1 vote.
4 - Now on the first iteration we will end up getting =  999 * 0.01 / 2000  = 0.004995 ether. 
5 - Note that for each subsequent iteration the 1 vote will be less in user's votes balance to calculate `votePrice`.

### Mitigation

```diff
while (votesSold < amount) {
      if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
        revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
      }
+     fundsReceived += votePrice;
      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
-     fundsReceived += votePrice;
      votesSold++;
    }
```
