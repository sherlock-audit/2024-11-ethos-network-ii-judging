# Incorrect accounting in sellVotes

### Summary

Inclusion of Protocol Fees and Donations in marketFunds in sellVotes
Funds change: fundsReceived
Funds distribute: fundsReceived + protocolFee 

### Root Cause

The marketFunds variable is intended to track the funds invested in the market. However, in the sellVotes function, marketFunds is decremented by fundsReceived, which doesn't include protocol fees. This inconsistency leads to marketFunds inaccurately representing the actual funds invested in the market. 

```solidity
      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
      fundsReceived += votePrice;
      votesSold++;
    }
-->    (fundsReceived, protocolFee, ) = previewFees(fundsReceived, false);
    minPrice = votePrice;

    return (votesSold, fundsReceived, votePrice, protocolFee, minPrice, maxPrice);
  }
```
[ReputationMarket.sol#L1041](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1041)

```solidity
  function previewFees(
    uint256 amount,
    bool isEntry
  ) private view returns (uint256 funds, uint256 protocolFee, uint256 donation) {
    if (isEntry) {
      protocolFee = (amount * entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;
      donation = (amount * donationBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;
    } else {
      protocolFee = (amount * exitProtocolFeeBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;
    }
-->    funds = amount - protocolFee - donation;
  }
```
Protocol fees are withdrawn immidiately this means that market creator will not be able to withdraw his funds later in `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds`

Incorrect accounting leading to market creator will not be able to withdraw his funds

### Mitigation

I think it suppose to be like this
Funds change: fundsReceived
Funds distribute: fundsReceived
```diff
    // apply protocol fees
    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

    // send the proceeds to the seller
    _sendEth(fundsReceived);
    // tally market funds
-    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
+    marketFunds[profileId] -= (fundsReceived + protocolFee);

```
