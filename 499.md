# Fees receiver can DoS vouches and slashes

### Summary

The README states the following regarding trusted entities: `"Fee receiver should not have any additional access (beyond standard users), though if the fee receiver is set to owner/admin that's fine."`.

From that sentence it can be deduced that fee receiver is not always trusted since they should not have any additional access and they will not always be an owner/admin.

Protocol fee is always sent to the `protocol fee receiver` directly during calls to vouch:

[EthosVouch.sol#L883-L886](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L883-L886)
```javascript
  function _depositProtocolFee(uint256 amount) internal {
    (bool success, ) = protocolFeeAddress.call{ value: amount }("");
    if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Protocol fee deposit failed");
  }
```

Also during slashing:

[EthosVouch.sol#L547-L550)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L547-L550)
```javascript
    if (totalSlashed > 0) {
      // Send slashed funds to protocol fee address
      (bool success, ) = protocolFeeAddress.call{ value: totalSlashed }("");
      if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Slash transfer failed");
    }
```

The protocol fee address can revert these external calls (i.e revert in receive() function) and DoS vouches and/or slashing.

### Root Cause

External call to `protocolFeeAddress` in each vouch and slash call

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User calls vouch
2. ETH is sent to `protocolFeeAddress`, triggers `receive()` function
3. `protocolFeeAddress` reverts within `receive()` function, causing DoS

### Impact

Denial of Service, fee receiver having additional access to cause harm to the protocol

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Use pull method over push method, so instead of making an external call to `protocolFeeAddress`, creating an internal accounting mechanism so the `protocolFeeAddress` can collect the fees themselves.

Ensure to also be aware of this in `ReputationMarket.sol`, as the issue can apply there as well.
