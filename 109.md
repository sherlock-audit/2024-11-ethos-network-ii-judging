# Inconsistent MarketFunds Tracking in `ReputationMarket::sellVotes` Leads to Potential Break of the protocol

### Summary

In the `ReputationMarket` contract, the [sellVotes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L522) function updates the `marketFunds` value incorrectly by subtracting only the seller's payout while ignoring protocol fees.
This creates an overestimation of the funds available in `marketFunds[profileId]`. As a result:

The `marketFunds` value for a market can become larger than the actual contract balance.
In a multi-market scenario, a withdrawal from one market can deplete funds intended for others, leading to a cross-market fund drain.




### Root Cause

In the `sellVotes` we call [`_calculateSell`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1003) in which before returning the data we call [`previewFees`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1151) here we substract the protocolFee from the funds, this means that at the end in  `sellVotes`, `fundsReceived` doesn't include `protocolFee`.
This means the balance of  `ReputationMarket` is decreased without tracking it in `MarketFunds`, this means  `ReputationMarket` have an inflated view of what's in the balance.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. During a sellVotes call:
    The seller receives a payout after deducting protocol fees and donations.
    The protocol does not adjust marketFunds[profileId] to account for these fees and donations.
2. The protocol accumulates these discrepancies over multiple sellVotes transactions.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The attacker observes that the marketFunds[profileId] value for a market exceeds the actual contract balance due to the tracking discrepancy.
2. The attacker initiates a withdrawal for the inflated marketFunds[profileId].
3. The withdrawal depletes the contractâ€™s Ether balance, potentially draining funds reserved for other markets.

### Impact

Withdrawals from one market can take funds intended for other markets.
The protocol becomes unable to honor market fund withdrawals, breaking its invariant `The vouch and vault contracts must never revert a transaction due to running out of funds.`


### PoC

A simple case scenario would be
SellVotes is called.
After `_calculateSell` we have:
      - `fundsReceived=0.9ETH` (sent to the `User`)
      - `protocolFee=0.1ETH` (sent to the `protocolFeeAddress`). 
0.9 ETH is substracted from `MarketFunds` **But** 1ETH is substracted from `ReputationMarket` balance.

### Mitigation

```javascript
marketFunds[profileId] -= (fundsReceived + protocolFee);  // deduct both user funds and fees
```
