# # Anyone Can Get Ether from This Contract


### Summary
Anyone can buy votes at a low price and sell them for a higher price.

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L942

### Internal pre-conditions
N/A

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Attack Path
Described in the Proof of Concept (PoC)

### Impact
Anyone can get ether until there is no ether in this contract.
And then votes can not be sold.
This represents a design error.

Assume that `market.votes[0] := v0`, `market.votes[1] := v1`, and `market.basePrice := b`. 
Without loss of generality, assume that `v0 <= v1`.
If someone buys `2n` votes in the following order:
    vote0, vote1, vote0, vote1, ..., vote0, vote1, the total price is denoted as `t1`. 
When they sell the `n` number of `vote0`s and then sell `n` number of `vote1`s, the total price is denoted as `t2`.
Then:
    t1 = b * sum((v0 + i)/(v0 + v1 + 2*i) + (v1 + i)/(v0 + v1 + 2*i + 1)), (i = [0,n-1])
    t2 = b * (sum((v0 + i)/(v0 + v1 + n + i)) + sum((v1 + i)/(v0 + v1 + i))), (i = [0,n-1])
It follows that `t1 < t2` (when `n>1`)
For example:
    Let `v0 := 1`, `v1 := 1`, and `n := 2`. Then 
    `t1 = b * (1/2 + 1/3 + 2/4 + 2/5)`,`t2 = b * (2/5 + 1/4 + 2/3 + 1/2)`. Thus `t1 < t2`.
    Let `v0 := 1`, `v1 := 1`, and `n := 10`. Then 
    `t1 = b * (1/2 + 1/3 + 2/4 + 2/5 + ... + 11/21 + 11/22) = b*9.40956`
    Including the fee : `t1 * 10000 / (10000 - entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints - donationBasisPoints) <= t1/0.9 = b*10.45507`
    `t2 = b * (10/21 + 9/20 + 8/19 + ... + 1/12 + 10/11 + 9/10 + ... + 1/2) = b*11.09983`
    Excluding the fee : `t2 * (10000 - exitProtocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10000 >= t2*0.95 = b*10.54484`
    Thus, the user gains at least `t2*0.95 - t1/0.9 = b*0.08977`
    when `v0 := 1`, `v1 := 1`, and `n := 20`, they gain at least `b*0.98166`
    when `v0 := 1`, `v1 := 1`, and `n := 100`, they gain at least `b*10.37776`
    when `v0 := 1000`, `v1 := 1000`, and `n := 100000`, they gain at least `b*9592.32668`

If someone performs this operation multiple times or selects `n` correctly, they can acquire most of the ether in this contract.
