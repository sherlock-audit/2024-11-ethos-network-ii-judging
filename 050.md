# Missing check in `unvouch()` allows compromised or deleted address to steal balance

## Description
The protocol comments the following [inside unvouch()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L456-L458):
```text
    // because it's $$$, you can only withdraw/unvouch to the same address you used to vouch
    // however, we don't care about the status of the address's profile; funds are always attached
    // to an address, not a profile
```
But the protocol does not also check if the address belongs to the profile anymore.

This leads to the following vulnerability:
1. Alice vouches for Bob using address A1.
2. A1 gets compromised and Alice marks it as compromised. (Alternatively, A1 is deleted by Alice and A1 gets assigned to some other profile id).
3. The attacker who compromised A1 can still call `unvouch()`.
4. The funds get sent back to A1, which the attacker now controls.
5. Alice has no recourse to block the attacker's actions or recover her funds.

## Impact
Two impacts:
1. A compromised/deleted address is able to steal the funds via `unvouch()`.
2. Even if a check is introduced to block such addresses from receiving funds, there exists no way to rescue these funds and return to the rightful author.

## Proof of Concept
Apply the following patch inside `test/EthosVouch.test.ts` and see it pass when run via `npm run hardhat -- test --grep "should allow compromised address to unvouch and receive funds"`:

+      });
+
     });
   });
 });

```

## Mitigation 
1. Add the check to revert if a compromised/deleted author address attempts to be the recipient of `unvouch()`:
```diff
  function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
    _vouchShouldExist(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);
    // because it's $$$, you can only withdraw/unvouch to the same address you used to vouch
    // however, we don't care about the status of the address's profile; funds are always attached
    // to an address, not a profile
    if (vouches[vouchId].authorAddress != msg.sender) {
      revert AddressNotVouchAuthor(vouchId, msg.sender, vouches[vouchId].authorAddress);
    }
    
+   // get the profile id of the author
+    uint256 profileId = IEthosProfile(
+      contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
+    ).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);
+    _vouchShouldBelongToAuthor(vouchId, profileId);

    v.archived = true;
    // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
    v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt = block.timestamp;
    // remove the vouch from the tracking arrays and index mappings
    _removeVouchFromArrays(v);

    // apply fees and determine how much is left to send back to the author
    (uint256 toWithdraw, ) = applyFees(v.balance, false, v.subjectProfileId);
    // set the balance to 0 and save back to storage
    v.balance = 0;
    // send the funds to the author
    // note: it sends it to the same address that vouched; not the one that called unvouch
    (bool success, ) = payable(v.authorAddress).call{ value: toWithdraw }("");
    if (!success) {
      revert FeeTransferFailed("Failed to send ETH to author");
    }

    emit Unvouched(v.vouchId, v.authorProfileId, v.subjectProfileId);
  }
```

2. The second fix is more of a design decision which the protocol can take. There should be a way to recover this fund on calling `unvouch()`. Either a new convenience function `reassignVouchAddress()` can be added which looks something like this:
```js
function reassignVouchAddress(
    uint256 vouchId, 
    address newAddress,
    bytes calldata signature  // Signed proof of new address ownership
) external {
```
Or the admin could float a proposal which allows them to rescue funds from such compromised vouches, and introduce a new function for the same.
