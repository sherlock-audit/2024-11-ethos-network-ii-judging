# Buyer is not removed from a given market's participants nor unmarked when they sell all their votes

## Summary
When a buyer purchases votes for a given market they are added to the participants in that market and are marked as participants in `isParticipant`, but when they sell all their votes - they are not removed from the participants nor unmarked. In turn, the number of market participants are always increasing and do not give an accurate reflection of how many users are actually active participants (i.e have votes) in that market, and a market owner cannot track who has active votes in the market.

## Vulnerability Details
Users call [ReputationMarket::buyVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442-L493) to purchase votes in a given market. By purchasing votes, they become participants in that market and are added to that market's participant's storage:

```solidity
    ...
    // Add buyer to participants if not already a participant
    if (!isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender]) {
      participants[profileId].push(msg.sender);
      isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = true;
    }
    ...
```

Conversely, if that same user sells all their votes - they should be removed from the tracking of that particular market's participants, but this is not the case - as no such checks are made in [ReputationMarket::sellVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L534).

## Impact
While these market participants tracking is only used once in the code when users buy votes as I've shown above, this would be problematic for market owners who try to get the real count of participants in their market, or those who have sold their votes and are no longer participants.

An intent to make this possible is highlighted in the [comments](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L119-L123):

```solidity
...
  // profileId => participant address
  // append only; don't bother removing. Use isParticipant to check if they've sold all their votes.
  mapping(uint256 => address[]) public participants;
  // profileId => participant => isParticipant
  mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => bool)) public isParticipant;
...
```

As the comments show, trying to remove a participant from the append-only mapping shouldn't be bothered with, but at the very least accurate tracking in `isParticipant` mapping is paramount, and this is missing when users sell their votes.

## Recommendation
Add the following check in `sellVotes()`:

```solidity
  function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    ...

    // update the market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;

    // @audit-fix
    if (votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[TRUST] == 0
        && votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[DISTRUST] == 0
    ) {
            // mark as inactive participant
            isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = false;
    }
    ...
  }
```

While this will cause the user buying votes again in that market to be added to `participants[profileId]`, this is where I would suggest better tracking of the number of users as the current one is not even going to be reiterated and would only be checked for length:

```solidity
  mapping(uint256 => uint256) public participants;
```

This way you can simply just increment in `buyVotes()` like this:

```solidity
    ...
    // Add buyer to participants if not already a participant
    if (!isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender]) {
      participants[profileId] += 1;
      isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = true;
    }
    ...
```

And add the following change to my correction for `sellVotes`:

```solidity
    // @audit-fix
    if (votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[TRUST] == 0
        && votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[DISTRUST] == 0
    ) {
            // mark as inactive participant
            isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = false;
            participants[profileId] -= 1;             // @new-add
    }
```

This way you can accurately keep track of the number of market participants while also accurately preserving the `isParticipant` storage.
