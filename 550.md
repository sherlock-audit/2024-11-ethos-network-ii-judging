# Protocol allows marking every vouch unhealthy which allows and attacker to lower profile's trust which can lead to loss of funds.

### Summary

The documentation describes the mutual vouch scenario. In this scenario when two profiles vouch for each other and later one of the accounts unvouch, then this vouch can be marked as unhealthy. The issue is that in current implementation, every vouch can be marked as unhealthy. Profiles don't have to be mutually vouched for the vouch to be marked unhealthy. This allows an attacker to lower the profiles trust and ruin thier reputation. When profile has very low trust and bad reputation it can cause a financial problems as users are expected to make financial decisions based on profile's trust.

### Root Cause

We can see that, in `markUnhealthy` function, every vouch can be mark unhealhty.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The attacker needs to vouch for a profile
2. Then the attacker can unvouch from the profile and mark the vouch unhealthy

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The attacker has to vouch
2. The attacker has to unvouch and mark the vouch unhealthy
3. He can repeat that process over and over again leading to lower trust (marking unhealthy lowers profile's trust).
4. Victim's profile trust will be lowered into state in which other users will unvouch from that profile (or stop them from vouching or stop them making any other financial decision based on profiles trust) profile and it can lead to financial losses as lower trust might cause financial problem for that profile.

### Impact

An attacker can lower user's trust by repeatedly vouching, unvouching and marking vouches unhealty. This will lead to avalanche decline in trust. This can cause financial problems for that profile.

Other users will not vouch for that profile and that profile will not earn DONATION fees.

As a result the lowering reputation can be used to game the market created by that profile in `ReputationMarket` contract. An attacker can manipulate the profiles trust and earn money on that event. In `ReputationMarket` the participants can buy `TRUST` and `DISTRUST` votes. The attacker has an incentive in marking the vouches unhealthy.

### PoC

The `markUnhealthy` function allows marking every vouch unhealthy.

### Mitigation

Implement the expected functionaliy in which only when the mutual unvouch has happen the vouch can be marked unhealthy.
