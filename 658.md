# Reorg Risk in unVouched and markUnhealthy Timing

## Summary
In EthosVouch, users have a 24-hour window after unVouching to mark a vouch as unHealthy. However, reorgs on L2 chains like Polygon and Optimism can delay transactions, causing them to fall outside the allowed timeframe. This can prevent the marking of malicious actors as unHealthy, undermining the protocol's integrity.
## Vulnerability Detail
L2 chains are prone to reorgs with significant block depth (e.g., 100+ blocks on Polygon).
Transaction timing discrepancies due to reorgs can shift a valid markUnhealthy transaction from within the allowed 24-hour window (T1) to beyond it (T2).

Reorgs on chains like Polygon can delay transactions by 30+ minutes due to depth.
## Impact
Malicious actors may avoid being marked unHealthy if reorgs delay transactions past the 24-hour limit.
This creates a loophole, reducing the protocol's effectiveness in punishing bad actors and protecting honest participants.

## Recommendation
Allow protocol admins to manually intervene in edge cases where reorgs affect marking unHealthy.Replace time-dependent logic with event or block-number-based tracking to ensure reorg resilience.
