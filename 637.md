# Separate calculation of fees in applyFees results in inflated total fee percentage.

### Summary

The separate calculation of fees in applyFees using multiple calls to calcFee causes a higher total fee percentage than expected. This leads to users being overcharged because each fee is calculated independently, rather than as a proportion of the total deposit. As a result, the total effective fee exceeds the intended basis points when multiple fees are applied.

### Root Cause

In thosVouch.sol:936 : https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L936

In the applyFees function of the EthosVouch contract, the protocol fee, donation fee, and vouchers pool fee are calculated independently using the calcFee function. This results in compounding effects where the combined fees are higher than intended.


### Internal pre-conditions

1.  applyFees is called with amount and configured basis points for protocol, donation, and vouchers pool fees.
2. Each fee (protocol, donation, and vouchers pool) is calculated using calcFee, which computes the fee based on the provided basis points independently of other fees.

### External pre-conditions

1. A user initiates an operation that triggers applyFees, such as buying or selling votes, where multiple fees are involved.
2. The basis points for each fee (entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints, entryDonationFeeBasisPoints, entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints) are configured with non-zero values.

### Attack Path

1. The user makes a transaction that triggers applyFees (e.g., buying votes).
2. The protocol calculates multiple fees (protocol, donation, vouchers pool) using calcFee independently.
4. Due to separate fee calculations, the total effective fee percentage exceeds the sum of the intended basis points, leading to user overcharging.

### Impact

Affected users are overcharged due to inflated fees. For example:
	•	If entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints = 2000 (20%) and entryDonationFeeBasisPoints = 2500 (25%), the total fee is expected to be 4500 basis points (45%). However, due to independent calculations, the effective fee becomes approximately 5789 basis points (57.89%), as shown in the testFee example.

The protocol’s reputation and user trust may suffer due to higher-than-expected charges.

### PoC

```solidity
function testFee() external {
    uint256 feeBasisPoints = 2000; // 20%
    uint256 feeBasisPoints2 = 2500; // 25%
    uint256 total = 300000000000000; // 0.3 ETH

    // Separate fee calculation
    uint256 fee1 = total -
        (total.mulDiv(10000, (10000 + feeBasisPoints), Math.Rounding.Floor));
    uint256 fee2 = total -
        (total.mulDiv(10000, (10000 + feeBasisPoints2), Math.Rounding.Floor));

    console.log(fee1 + fee2, total - fee1 - fee2); // Inflated fee: 5789 basis points (~57.89%)

    // Combined fee calculation
    uint256 fee3 = total -
        (total.mulDiv(10000, (10000 + feeBasisPoints2 + feeBasisPoints), Math.Rounding.Floor));

    console.log(fee3, total - fee3); // Correct fee: 4500 basis points (45%)
}
```

### Mitigation

1.   Calculate the total fee for all basis points in one step.
2.  Distribute the total fee proportionally to the respective components.
3.  Update applyFees to use the combined fee calculation logic, ensuring the total effective fee matches the expected sum of basis points.
