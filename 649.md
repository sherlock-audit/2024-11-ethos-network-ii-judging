# Absence of slippage protection in sellVotes allows potential economic losses for users.

### Summary

The sellVotes function in the ReputationMarket contract lacks slippage protection, unlike the buyVotes function, which implements this safeguard via _checkSlippageLimit. This inconsistency can lead to users receiving significantly fewer funds than expected when selling votes, especially in volatile or low-liquidity markets, exposing them to potential economic losses.

### Root Cause

In ReputationMarket.sol:495 : https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495

The absence of slippage protection in the sellVotes function means the contract does not verify whether the funds received for sold votes meet the userâ€™s minimum expectations. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1.	The sellVotes function is invoked with valid parameters (profileId, isPositive, and amount).
2.	The market has sufficient liquidity for the sale (votesAvailable and marketFunds are adequate).

### External pre-conditions

1.	The market experiences high volatility or low liquidity, causing significant price fluctuations.
2.	The user assumes they will receive funds based on the current price but receives significantly less due to rapid price changes during the transaction.

### Attack Path

1.	A malicious actor or market condition rapidly reduces the liquidity or changes the price in the market.
2.	A user calls sellVotes without realizing the price has dropped significantly.
3.	The user receives fewer funds than anticipated because the function lacks a mechanism to enforce a minimum acceptable price.

### Impact

Users may suffer financial losses due to receiving significantly less ETH than expected for their votes, especially in volatile markets.
