# Change the config Index with `removeMarketConfig()` is dangerous

### Summary

This function `ReputationMarket.sol#removeMarketConfig()` will change the config Index in the `marketConfigs[]` array. without warning the normal users about it. this will lead some user's transactions to end up with unexpected results 

### Root Cause

The function [ReputationMarket.sol#removeMarketConfig()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L403-L409) will change the config Index in `marketConfigs[]` array.
```solidity
    uint256 lastIndex = marketConfigs.length - 1;
    if (configIndex != lastIndex) {
      marketConfigs[configIndex] = marketConfigs[lastIndex];
    }

    marketConfigs.pop();
```

So, If a user called `createMarketWithConfig()` before `removeMarketConfig()` function gets executed on-chain the user market will end up in the wrong market configs.


e.g. the user asks to create a market with 0.001ETH as an `initialLiquidity` (he sends 0.002ETH), but the new `marketConfigs` in that index has an `intialLiquidity` of 0.002ETH. The user expects to receive back his 0.001ETH. because the logic guaranteed that

### Internal pre-conditions

 Admin triggers `ReputationMarket.sol#removeMarketConfig()`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1- currently the protocol has three market configurations Default, Deluxe & Premium
2- Admin call `removeMarketConfig()`. to remove the Default market configuration (The transaction is still not executed)
3- User triggers `createMarketWithConfig()` to create the Default market (The transaction is still not executed)
4- The Admin  transaction gets executed
5- The User transaction gets executed (create the market with the wrong configurations - lose the refund of the remaining funds)


### Impact

- The user doesn't receive expect the remaining funds, due to the difference in the `initialLiquidity`
- Users expect to create the market with X config but it ends up with Y config 
- The `basePrice` could be so high (or too low) that no one will buy a TRUST for him 
- Users are not able to close or change the wrong market config 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Add a buferr period or time lock so users can see the changes are coming soon to avoid this scenario 
- Or pause the contract and allow `removeMarketConfig()` to be callable
