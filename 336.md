# The maximum total fees can exceed 10%

### Summary

From the [ReadMe](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#q-are-there-any-limitations-on-values-set-by-admins-or-other-roles-in-the-codebase-including-restrictions-on-array-lengths) file. one of the limitations on values that are set by admins is **For both contracts: Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%**


### Root Cause

in [EthosVouch.sol:120](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120) the constant `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is 10_000 which is 100%. 
The constant `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` value used in the function `checkFeeExceedsMaximum()` which checks if the new fee would cause the total fees to exceed the maximum allowed.
This function used in four functions **only callable by admin** `setExitFeeBasisPoints()`, `setEntryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints()`, `setEntryDonationFeeBasisPoints()` and `setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints()`.

### Internal pre-conditions

Admin needs to call e.g. `setExitFeeBasisPoints()` and set the `exitFeeBasisPoints` to a big/unfair percentage e.g. 99%

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1- Admin set the total fees to a fair percentage e.g. 5%
2- Normal users start invoking `vouchByProfileId()` and `vouchByAddress()`
3- Admin Triggers `setExitFeeBasisPoints()` and set the `exitFeeBasisPoints` to an unfair percentage e.g. 99%
4- Normal user calls `unvouch()` function to Unvouches vouch, but after applying fees the amount that is left to send back to the author is only  1%

### Impact

The protocol can take all the staked ETH from the users as a fees (could be any type of fee)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
- uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
+ uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000;
```
