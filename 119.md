# Malicious market creator(not the contract owner) can withdraw all of ethers of `ReputationMarket` contract.

### Summary

This issue is very simply **Anyone can withdraw all of initialLiquidity whenever the market starts with the default market configuration(Default tier).** that I submitted first.

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The user who can create a market is able to create a market with the default market configuration(Default tier).
2. The user alternately buys votes (first a trust vote, then a distrust vote, and then repeats this process) in large quantities (for example, 999,999).
3. The user sells all of their distrust votes and then sells all of their trust votes.

### Impact

The `ReputationMarket` contract will lose all Ether.

### PoC

We are able to test amount of ETHs simply.

```javascript
const _1E18 = 1e18
const BASE_VOTES = 2
/// DEFAULT_PRICE is 0.01 ether
const DEFAULT_PRICE = 0.01
const DEFAULT_GAS_LIMIT = 21000 / _1E18

const buyVotesAlternately = (n) => {
	let sum = 0

	for(let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		const k = BASE_VOTES + i
		const a = Math.floor(k / 2)
		sum += a / k
	}
	return sum * DEFAULT_PRICE
}

const sellVotesTrustAndThenDisTrust = (n) => {
	let sum = 0

	const edgePoint = Math.floor((n + 1) / 2)
	for(let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
		if (i < edgePoint) {
			sum += (i + 1) / (i + 2)
		} else {
			sum += (i - edgePoint + 1) / (i + 2)
		}
	}
	return sum * DEFAULT_PRICE
}

const Result = (n) => {
	const totalAmountBuyVotes = buyVotesAlternately(n)
	const totalAmountSellVotes = sellVotesTrustAndThenDisTrust(n)
	const maximumFeeAndDonation = totalAmountBuyVotes / 10 + totalAmountSellVotes / 20
	const normalGasPrice = (n + 2) * DEFAULT_GAS_LIMIT
	const gain = totalAmountSellVotes - totalAmountBuyVotes - maximumFeeAndDonation - normalGasPrice
	console.log(`Total amount buy votes: ${totalAmountBuyVotes} ether`)
	console.log(`Total amount sell votes: ${totalAmountSellVotes} ether`)
	console.log(`Margin: ${totalAmountSellVotes - totalAmountBuyVotes} ether`)
	console.log(`Maximum value of fees and donation: ${maximumFeeAndDonation} ether`)
	console.log(`Total gas price: About ${normalGasPrice} ether`)
	console.log(`Gain: ${gain} ether`)
}
```

Results of `Result(999,999)`

Total amount buy votes: 4999.962285316473 ether
Total amount sell votes: 6534.132669911702 ether
Margin: 1534.1703845952288 ether
Maximum value of fees and donation: 826.7028620272324 ether
Total gas price: About 2.1000021e-8 ether
Gain: 707.4675225469964 ether


### Mitigation

1. **Increase Initial Votes**
- Propose an increase in the initial number of votes.

2. **Adjust Maximum Donation to 6%**
- The current maximum donation and fees are set at 5%. However, since the **maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%**, the market owner may have the option to set donations and fees at 6% and 4%, respectively. This adjustment could help address the issue.

3. **Set Limits on the Amount of Votes Users Can Buy/Sell**
- Establish a limit on the number of votes that users can buy or sell, based on the total votes available in the market.
