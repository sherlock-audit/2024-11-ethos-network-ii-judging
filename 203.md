# Market Funds Are Incorrectly Recorded

### Summary

The `ReputationMarket.sellVotes()` function records inflated `marketFunds` by including protocol fees and donations that are transferred elsewhere. This discrepancy can cause the admin's `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()` transaction to revert or result in unauthorized withdrawal from other market funds.


### Root Cause

- The `ReputationMarket.sellVotes()` function incorrectly records the `marketFunds` inflated:
  - The function adds the entire `fundsPaid` to the `marketFunds` mapping:
  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481
  ```solidity
    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
  ```
  - The `fundsPaid` includes vote prices, protocol fees, and donations:
  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L970-L978
  ```solidity
      while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
        fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
  @>    fundsPaid += votePrice;
        votesBought++;

        market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += 1;
        votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
      }
  @>  fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;
  ```
  - However, the `protocolFee` is sent to `protocolFeeAddress`, and `donation` is claimed by the market recipient.
- Admin withdraw the `marketFunds` for the graduated market by calling `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L675
```solidity
    _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]);
```

### Attack Path

1. `entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints = 50` and `donationBasisPoints = 50`.
2. User buy votes for a market by paying `10000 wei`.
3. Fees are calculated and transferred.
  - `protocolFee = 10000 * 50 / 10000 = 50` are transferred to `protocolFeeAddress`.
  - `donation = 10000 * 50 / 10000 = 50` are claimed by the market recipient.
4. `marketFunds` increases by `10000` including the fees instead of `9900`.
5. Admin graduates the market and withdraw the `marketFunds`.
6. The admin's tx reverts due to running out of funds or mistakenly takes out another market's funds.


### Impact

- Loss of funds because another market's funds can be taken out.
- Break of the invariants of README:
> The vouch and vault contracts must never revert a transaction due to running out of funds.

### Mitigation

Record the correct funds as follows:
```diff
-   marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
+   marketFunds[profileId] += (fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation);
```
