# Maximum Total Fees Mismatch Between README and Implementation

### Summary

Incorrect `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` constant value will cause excessive fee charges (up to 100% instead of 10%) for users as admins can set fees much higher than documented.

### Root Cause

In EthosVouch.sol
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120 
the constant `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is set to 10000 basis points (100%) while documentation explicitly states maximum total fees should not exceed 10%.
`uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000; // Allows 100% fees`

This constant is used in [checkFeeExceedsMaximum](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L996) to assert that the total fee should be greater than this constant. Which in this case will allow fee to be more than 10%, it can reach to 99.99%

### Internal pre-conditions

Admin needs to call any of this function
setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints
setEntryDonationFeeBasisPoints
setEntryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints
setExitFeeBasisPoints 
to set fees above 10%

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users could suffer up to a 90% higher loss of funds than documented through excessive fee settings. This dramatically changes the economics and trust assumptions of the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000; // 10% maximum
