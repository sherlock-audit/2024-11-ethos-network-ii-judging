# Blocked profiles can still create markets

### Summary

The function [createMarketWithConfigAdmin](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L301-L307) in `ReputationMarket.sol` is missing a check for blocked accounts (`!creationAllowedProfileIds[senderProfileId]`), which can be exploited to create a market even when the profile ID is blocked from doing so.


### Root Cause

`ReputationMarket::createMarketWithConfigAdmin` should revert if the user's profile is blacklisted from creating a market.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. The admin needs to call `ReputationMarket::createMarketWithConfigAdmin`, as this function is restricted to admin-level access.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The user's profile is blocked from creating a market.  
2. The admin is unaware that the `createMarketWithConfigAdmin` function is missing checks for blocked accounts.  
3. The admin calls `createMarketWithConfigAdmin` with a blocked profile ID.  
4. The market is created despite the user being blocked from creating a market.  


### Impact

Profiles blocked from creating markets can still bypass restrictions and create a market.
