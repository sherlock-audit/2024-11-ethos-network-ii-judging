# Users can escape slashing everytime they might get slashed by simply unvouching before 24h pass

### Summary

> Any Ethos participant may act as a "whistleblower" to accuse another participant of inaccurate claims or unethical behavior. This accusation triggers a 24h lock on staking (and withdrawals) for the accused. 
> 
> The whistleblower requests human validation by pledging a nominal reward to validators. Validators vote to indicate if they found the claims valid. Validators are rewarded the same whichever way they vote. 
> 
> If validators vote in favor of the whistleblower, they reward the whistleblower pledged to validators is reimbursed from the amount staked by the accused. This is the "slashing punishment," and it cannot exceed 10% of the total amount staked in Ethos.

this how slashing works, however locking (vouch/unvouch) and withdrawals for 24h wasn't implemented. which makes it easy to any `profileid` was accused of unerthical behavior to `unvouch` all his Vouches and gets all his ETH, so when onlyslasher invoke `slash` function there will be no ETH at Vouches to slash.

[EthosVouch.sol, unvouch()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L452C2-L482C1)

### impact
any accused participant of inaccurate claims or unethical behavior can avoid slashing.
slashing will be useless as it can be bypassed every time without any external pre-conditions.

### recommendations
Lock users funds and revert if it was locked at `unvouch()`
