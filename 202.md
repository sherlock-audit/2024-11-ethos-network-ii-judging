# Incorrect Fee Calculation in checkFeeExceedsMaximum Function

### Summary

The checkFeeExceedsMaximum function has a critical flaw where the calculation for totalFees incorrectly subtracts currentFee, leading to scenarios where the actual total fees exceed the MAX_TOTAL_FEES limit without triggering a revert.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L996-L1004

The function should check totalfees like this  : where the totalfees is the fees of the sum of all the fees basis points.





### Root Cause

The function should check totalfees like this  : where the totalfees is the fees of the sum of all the fees basis points.


uint256 totalFees = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints + exitFeeBasisPoints + entryDonationFeeBasisPoints + 
      entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints + newFee 


But it checks totalfees like this 



uint256 totalFees = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints + exitFeeBasisPoints +entryDonationFeeBasisPoints + entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints + newFee - current_fee


Analysis 

let These things 
entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints = 300 (3%)
exitFeeBasisPoints = 300 (3%)
entryDonationFeeBasisPoints = 200 (2%)
entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints = 100 (10%)
MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000 (10%)


Faulty Pass Scenario:

Suppose:

currentFee = 1000 (1%)
newFee = 1000 (10%)
Function calculation:


uint256 totalFees = 3000 + 3000 + 2000 + 1000 + 1000 - 1000;
                   = 9000


The function calculates totalFees as 9000, which is below MAX_TOTAL_FEES, so it doesn't revert.


Actual total fees:
uint256 totalFees = 3000 + 3000 + 2000 + 1000 + 1000;

The actual total fees are 10000, exceeding MAX_TOTAL_FEES, but the function fails to detect this due to subtracting currentFee.




### Impact

Impact : High
Likelihood : Low (Admin can only change fees)

Severity : Medium 

Admin settting the fees to 100% unknowningly will lead to all the vouch stakes to the protocol itself.

All the staking balance goes to the protocol himself, there is nothing left when unvouching.

Acoording to sherlock rules "If a protocol defines restrictions on the owner/admin, issues involving attacks that bypass these restrictions may be considered valid." 

The Invarient on the admin fees setting is clearly bypassed,



### Mitigation
```solidity
uint256 totalFees = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints + exitFeeBasisPoints + entryDonationFeeBasisPoints + 
      entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints + newFee 
```
