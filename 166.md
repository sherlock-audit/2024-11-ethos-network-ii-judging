# Vouchers can pay less fees through `increaseVouch`

### Summary

When `increaseVouch` is called the caller must pay the `vouchersPoolFee` which rewards all profiles that have also vouched for the subject. The issue is that the caller's profile will also be rewarded, thus taking a portion of the fee that should be allocated to the rest of the profiles. This is problematic because if a voucher intends to vouch a significant amount they can pay fewer fees by first vouching the minimum amount and after that increasing the vouch to their desired amount.

### Root Cause

In `_rewardPreviousVouchers` it is not validated whether the profile being rewarded is not the same as the profile increasing the vouch:

### Attack Path

1. For simplicity let's say that 10% of a vouch must be rewarded to previous vouchers (this is not factually correct as the percent of the total fees cannot exceed 10%).
2. A profile wants to vouch for another profile with 10 ETH, currently, the other profile has been vouched with the minimum amount, thus, 1 ETH of the vouch amount will have to be deducted for the `entryVouchersPoolFee`. 
3. However, in order to decrease that fee the voucher can firstly vouch the minimum amount, paying 10% of 0.0001 ETH = 0.00001 ETH for the `entryVouchersPoolFee` and after that increase the vouch by 10 ETH - 0.0001 = 9.9999 ETH.
4. Now the voucher will be allocated 50% of the `entryVouchersPoolFee` as they own 50% of the total vouches, thus they will have to pay only 5% of 9.9999 = 0.499995 ETH.
5. Essentially, instead of paying 1 ETH for the `entryVouchersPoolFee` they only pay 0.499995 + 0.00001 = 0.500005 ETH, which is half of what they should actually pay

### Impact

Vouchers can decrease the fees they have to pay.

### Mitigation

Do not allocate a portion of the `entryVouchersPoolFee` to a profile if it is the same as the profile of the voucher.
