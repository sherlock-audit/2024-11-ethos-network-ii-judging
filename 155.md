# Incorrect vote price calculation may lead to potential protocol drain

### Summary

In the `ReputationMarket.sol` protocol, users can buy and sell votes. However, the protocol incorrectly calculates the vote price, allowing users to buy votes at a low price and sell them at a higher price. 
This issue may leads to user drain protocol fund. And it break the property in README "They must never pay out the initial liquidity deposited." 

### Root Cause

In `buyVotes`, it calls `_calculateBuy` to calc the total vote price.

In `_calculateBuy`, it calc the first vote price before update vote number. 
```solidity
  {
    uint256 fundsAvailable;
    (fundsAvailable, protocolFee, donation) = previewFees(funds, true);
    uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive); // calc first vote price 

    uint256 minPrice = votePrice;
    uint256 maxPrice;

    if (fundsAvailable < votePrice) {
      revert InsufficientFunds();
    }

    while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
      fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
      fundsPaid += votePrice;
      votesBought++;

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += 1; // update vote number 
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    }
    fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;

    maxPrice = votePrice;

    return (votesBought, fundsPaid, votePrice, protocolFee, donation, minPrice, maxPrice);
  }
```
In `sellVotes`, it calls `_calculateSell` to calc the total vote price. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/34606be941434e23fa428193c3d2b153a59a4b71/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1003
In `_calculateSell`, it also calc the first vote price before update vote number. 
This calculation method allows users to buy votes at a low price and sell them at a higher price. 

For example: 
1. the market is initialized with 100 trust votes and 100 distrust votes. 
2. Alice buys 3 votes, and the total vote price is `(100/200 + 101/201 + 102/202) * basePrice`
3. Alice then sells the 3 votes, and the total vote price is `(103/203 + 102/202 + 101/201) * basePrice`.
4. As a result, Alice could receive `(103/203 - 100/200) * basePrice` (excluding fees) by simply buying and selling votes.
5. If the total fee is less than `(103/203 - 100/200) * basePrice`, the protocol will use initial liquidity to pay the difference, breaking the property defined in the README. Alice can exploit this to drain the protocolâ€™s funds
