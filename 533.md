# `targetExistsAndAllowedForId` does not check for `unvouched` or `unhealthy` targetIds.

### Summary

The `targetExistsAndAllowedForId` function is used to check whether a target (vouchId) exists and whether it is "allowed" to be used, since the function is external, any protocol facet or External protocol leveraging it's output for other purposes can be DOS'd.
A target can have a `vouchedAt > 0` and be unvouched (not allowed to be used). so this function is implemented incorrectly.

### Root Cause

The function does not explicitly check if the vouch is archived or unhealthy, which might be relevant for determining if it's "allowed".

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. External protocol calls `targetExistsAndAllowedForId` with a vouch Id that has been unvouched and gets false information on whether it is allowed

```solidity
function targetExistsAndAllowedForId(
    uint256 targetId
  ) external view returns (bool exists, bool allowed) {
    Vouch storage vouch = vouches[targetId];

    exists = vouch.activityCheckpoints.vouchedAt > 0;
    allowed = exists;
  }
```

### Impact

DOS of integrating protocols, wrong information returned in external protocol or protocol facets that call `targetExistsAndAllowedForId`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

check whether the `vouchId` has been unvouched by checking the archived status and health status
