# A user will always loose some ether when selling their vote due to error in calculating `fundsReceived`

## Impact
### Summary 
The `ReputationMarket.sol` functions like betting where a user, say `userA` predicts that users are going to buy trust votes because they believe that the profile is trustworthy, so the `userA` buys trust votes by calling the `ReputationMarket::buyVotes` function before other users and once other users also buy trust votes, `userA` sell thiers by calling the `ReputationMarket::sellVotes` function, making profit by doing so.

However, the `votePrice` is wrongly used when selling votes thereby causing the seller to loose some ether, reducing their profit margin.

### Vulnerability Details
When a user wants to sell their votes, they call the `ReputationMarket::sellVotes` function which relies on the `ReputationMarket::_calculateSell` function to calculate the amount of ether to be received by the seller.

The vulnerability lies in the manner the `ReputationMarket::_calculateSell` function calculates the amount of ether due to the seller i.e. `fundsReceived`. After the necessary checks, the function checks the current `votePrice` given the prevailing market conditions. This initial `votePrice` is only set as `maxPrice` but is never used in calculating the `fundsReceived` rather, the protocol decrements `market.votes[...]` by 1, uses the new market condition to re-calculate the `votePrice` and then use is to calculate `fundsReceived`. Note that decrementing `market.votes[...]` by 1 also reduces the `votePrice`. As a result, the protocol does not use the `maxPrice` in calculation `fundsReceived` for the seller but uses a lower `votePrice`. Thus, the seller receives a less amount of ether than they should.

This vulnerability can be seen by checking this link https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1003-L1045 or by taking a look at the code snippet below. 

```javascript
   function _calculateSell(
    Market memory market,
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  )
    private
    view
    returns (
      uint256 votesSold,
      uint256 fundsReceived,
      uint256 newVotePrice,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    )
  {
    uint256 votesAvailable = votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST];


    if (votesAvailable < amount) {
      revert InsufficientVotesOwned(profileId, msg.sender);
    }


    uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);


    uint256 maxPrice = votePrice;
    uint256 minPrice;


    while (votesSold < amount) {
      if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
        revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
      }


      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
      fundsReceived += votePrice;
      votesSold++;
    }
    (fundsReceived, protocolFee, ) = previewFees(fundsReceived, false);
    minPrice = votePrice;


    return (votesSold, fundsReceived, votePrice, protocolFee, minPrice, maxPrice);
  } 

```


### Impact
Since the `maxPrice` is never used in the calculation of `fundsReceived`, the first vote is always sold at a lower price than the usual which translates into less amount of ether as `fundsReceived` due to the seller. As such, the seller receives less amount of ether than what is due to them.

## Proof of Concept
Let votes be bought and sold in the following manner:
1. Let the initial `votePrice` be a value say `votePrice_0`.
2. `userA` buys a vote thereby increasing the `votePrice` to a value say, `votePrice_1` such that `votePrice_1 > votePrice_0`
3. `userB` also buys a vote thereby further increasing the `votePrice` to a higher value say, `votePrice_2` such that `votePrice_2 > votePrice_1`
4. seeing that `votePrice_2` is much higher `votePrice_0` the price he bought a vote, `userA` decides to sell their vote hoping to get say `fundsReceived_1` corresponding to the current vote price `votePrice_2`. However, the protocol does not use `votePrice_2` to sell the vote of `userA` but uses `votePrice_1` which is a lower price. This causes `userA` to receive an amount of ether that is less than `fundsReceived_1`.

Place the following code into `rep.market.test.ts`.

```javascript
it.only('seller of a stake receives less ETH', async () => {
    await userA.buyOneVote(); // const { fundsPaid } = 

    // another user buys a trust vote
    await userB.buyOneVote();

    let priceBeforeSale = await DEFAULT.reputationMarket.getVotePrice(
      DEFAULT.profileId,
      DEFAULT.isPositive,
    );

    const { fundsReceived } = await userA.sellOneVote();

    let priceAfterSale = await DEFAULT.reputationMarket.getVotePrice(
      DEFAULT.profileId,
      DEFAULT.isPositive,
    );
    
    expect(fundsReceived).to.lessThan(priceBeforeSale);
    expect(fundsReceived).to.equal(priceAfterSale);
  });
```

Now run `npm run-script test:contracts`

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Consider modifying the `ReputationMarket::_calculateSell` to use the `maxPrice` for the first sell order before adjusting the vote price so that sellers get the amount of ether that is due to them as illustrated below

```diff
function _calculateSell(
    Market memory market,
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  )
    private
    view
    returns (
      uint256 votesSold,
      uint256 fundsReceived,
      uint256 newVotePrice,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    )
  {
    uint256 votesAvailable = votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST];


    if (votesAvailable < amount) {
      revert InsufficientVotesOwned(profileId, msg.sender);
    }


    uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);


    uint256 maxPrice = votePrice;
    uint256 minPrice;


    while (votesSold < amount) {
      if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
        revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
      }


      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
-     votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
      fundsReceived += votePrice;
      votesSold++;
+     votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    }
    (fundsReceived, protocolFee, ) = previewFees(fundsReceived, false);
    minPrice = votePrice;


    return (votesSold, fundsReceived, votePrice, protocolFee, minPrice, maxPrice);
  }
```
