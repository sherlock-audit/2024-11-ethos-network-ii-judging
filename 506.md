# Failure to Initialize `PausableUpgradeable` in EthosVouch Contract

## Summary

The current implementation of the `EthosVouch`  and `ReputationMarketcontract` fails to initialize the `PausableUpgradeable` module, which is necessary for pausing and unpausing contract functions

## Vulnerability Details

In the current implementation, `EthosVouch` inherits from `AccessControl`, which includes `PausableUpgradeable` as one of its dependencies:

```js
contract EthosVouch is AccessControl, UUPSUpgradeable, ITargetStatus, ReentrancyGuard {
```
The AccessControl contract inherits from PausableUpgradeable:
```js
abstract contract AccessControl is
  IPausable,
  PausableUpgradeable,
  AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable,
  SignatureControl
{
```
The `PausableUpgradeable` module is intended to be initialized using the `__Pausable_init` function. However, there is no explicit call to initialize `PausableUpgradeable` using `__Pausable_init` in the `initialize` function of the `EthosVouch` contract. This omission leaves the contract without the ability to function properly when attempting to pause or unpause.

## Impact
If the `PausableUpgradeable` functionality is not correctly initialized, the contract cannot be paused or unpaused

## Recommendation
Add a call to `__Pausable_init` in the contractâ€™s `initialize` function.
