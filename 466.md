# Improper fee cap allows total fees to exceed 10%

### Summary

The `EthosVouch` contract misconfigures the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` constant, setting it to `10000` (100%) instead of the intended `1000` (10%). This allows the total fees charged by the protocol to exceed the 10% cap, breaking the protocol's fee structure and potentially overcharging users. 

### Root Cause

The root cause of the issue is the incorrect configuration of the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` constant in the `EthosVouch` contract. It is set to `10000`, which represents 100% in basis points, instead of the intended `1000`, which correctly represents 10%. And also it is constant value. This misconfiguration causes the `checkFeeExceedsMaximum` function to validate against a 100% cap rather than the intended 10%, allowing cumulative fees to exceed the protocol's design limits.

### Impact

The misconfigured fee cap allows total fees to exceed the intended 10%, leading to overcharging users, violating protocol integrity, and reducing user trust and economic attractiveness.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` constant to `1000` to correctly enforce the 10% cap in basis points.

```diff
- uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
+ uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000;
```
