# Fees are also collected on refund amount at the time of buying votes

### Summary

- When user wants to buy votes, user provide eth in msg.value and user will get votes by calculating vote price with each count update. The last remaining eth which are less than vote price will be refunded to the user.
- Now there are 2 type of fees at the time of buying votes - protocol fees and donation fees. This fees should be collected on the amount of buying because that is the actual amount used for buying votes.
- But in the protocol, when user buys the vote and provide msg.value in eth, fees are collected to the whole eth which are provided for buying tokens. After that remaining eth amount is used to buy the votes and the last remaining eth amout which is not sufficient to buy vote are refunded to the user.

```solidity
function buyVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 expectedVotes,
    uint256 slippageBasisPoints
  ) public payable whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);
    (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
@>  ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);
      ...
```

```solidity
  function _calculateBuy(
    Market memory market,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 funds
  )
    private
    view
    returns (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      uint256 newVotePrice,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    )
  {
    uint256 fundsAvailable;
@>  (fundsAvailable, protocolFee, donation) = previewFees(funds, true);
    ...
```
- It shows that fees are collected on the whole msg.value that means fees are also collected on refunded eth amount which is not expected.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- Protocol fees and donation fees are also collected from the refunded eth amount ate the time of `buyVotes` which is loss for the buyer.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Protocol should make sure that both the fees should only collected from the actual amount of eth which are used to buy votes.
