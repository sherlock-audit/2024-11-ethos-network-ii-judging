# `ReputationMarket.sellVotes` doesn't update isParticipant value of `msg.sender`

### Summary

`ReputationMarket.sellVotes` doesn't update isParticipant value of `msg.sender` in case senders have sold all their votes.

### Root Cause

As described in the documentation comments, `isParticipant` mapping is used to determine whether a user is a participant of a reputation market or not. And can use `isParticipant` to check if senders have sold all their votes.
```solitidy
  // profileId => participant address
  // append only; don't bother removing. Use isParticipant to check if they've sold all their votes.
  mapping(uint256 => address[]) public participants;
  // profileId => participant => isParticipant
  mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => bool)) public isParticipant;
```

In the `buyVotes()` function, the current implementation updates the `isParticipant` mapping by adding buyer to participants if not already a participant.

```solidity
    if (!isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender]) {
      participants[profileId].push(msg.sender);
      isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = true;
    }
```

However, the current implementation lacks a similar update for the `sellVotes()` function, which does not change the state of `isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender]` from `true` to `false` for sellers who have sold all their votes.
