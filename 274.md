# Front-Running Vulnerability in _rewardPreviousVouchers Enables Malicious Reward Claims

### Summary

In the _rewardPreviousVouchers function, rewards are distributed proportionally among active vouches for a given subjectProfileId. However, since the function does not restrict new vouches just before rewards are distributed, a malicious user can detect an impending reward distribution and front-run the transaction by vouching a small amount. This allows them to unfairly claim a share of the rewards without meaningful prior contribution.

### Root Cause

```javascript
 function _rewardPreviousVouchers(
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 subjectProfileId
  ) internal returns (uint256 amountDistributed) {
    uint256[] storage vouchIds = vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId];
    uint256 totalVouches = vouchIds.length;

    // Calculate total balance of all active vouches
    uint256 totalBalance;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalVouches; i++) {
      Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];
      // Only include active (not archived) vouches in the distribution
      if (!vouch.archived) {
        totalBalance += vouch.balance;
      }
    }

    // If this is the first voucher, do not distribute rewards
    if (totalBalance == 0) {
      return totalBalance;
    }

    // Distribute rewards proportionally
    uint256 remainingRewards = amount;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalVouches && remainingRewards > 0; i++) {
      Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];
      if (!vouch.archived) {
        // Calculate this vouch's share of the rewards
        uint256 reward = amount.mulDiv(vouch.balance, totalBalance, Math.Rounding.Floor);
        if (reward > 0) {
          vouch.balance += reward;
          remainingRewards -= reward;
        }
      }
    }

    // Send any dust (remaining rewards due to rounding) to the subject reward escrow
    if (remainingRewards > 0) {
      _depositRewards(remainingRewards, subjectProfileId);
    }

    return amount;
  }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Legitimate contributors receive less than their fair share of the rewards.

### PoC

1. Alice Observes there is about to distribution of rewards
2. Alice quickly increases his balance to a high amount or borrow loans
3. Due to reward being proportioanal to balance Alice receive the most shares with minimal cost 

### Mitigation

Introduce a time-lock mechanism that prevents new vouches within a short period before reward distribution.
