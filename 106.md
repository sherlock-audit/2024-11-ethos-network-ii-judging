# Rewards being tied to a profileId rather than a single address allows any address associated with the same profileId to steal the rewards

### Summary

The protocol insists that funds should be tied to a single address, not the entire profile, as addresses associated with the same profile should only be socially linked. However, in EthosVouch, rewards are tied to the profileId rather than to a single address. This means that [any address associated with the same profileId](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L680) can call `EthosVouch::claimRewards()`, allowing rewards to be claimed by any address associated with the same profileId, including compromised ones.








### Root Cause

In `EthosVouch.sol::claimRewards()`, the rewards can be claimed by any address associated with the same profileId.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `entryDonationFeeBasisPoints` needs to be greater than `0`.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. A user vouches for a profileId by calling `EthosVouch::vouchByProfileId()`. The caller will pay a donation fee which will be tied to the profileId that they vouched for.
2. Any address associated is compromised.
3. That address calls `EthosVouch::claimRewards()` to claim the rewards associated with the profileId.

### Impact

A user may lose all of their rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider allowing only one of the addresses that are associated with the same profile to claim the rewards.
