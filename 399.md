# Users might end up creating an entirely different market than what they expected

### Summary

`removeMarketConfig` removes the index from `marketConfigs` array through swap and pop method. If a user called `createMarketWithConfig` during that same time, they might end up with a different market values. 

### Root Cause

The contract allows users to create market based on the index that they provide via `createMarketWithConfig`

Index provided by the user is fetched from `marketConfigs` array which gives initial configuration of the market that the user wants. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L107

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L65-L69

Adding and removing configurations from `marketConfig` array can be done via admin through 
a. `addMarketConfig`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L360-L383

b. `removeMarketConfig`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L389-L410

If we look at the process of removing market config, the function swaps the last element with the index element that is to be removed and then pops the last element. 

For example - if the given array is [ 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 ]  and we want to remove 5 then after swap and pop, array becomes [ 1, 3, 9, 7 ]

We can conclude 1 thing here :
` the sequence of marketConfigs will change if any configuration is removed from the array `

That means, if someone creates market with the same index , at the same time when that index if removed, then they might end up with a different configuration if removal transaction is executed first. 


### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to remove the same index that the user is trying to access. 
2. Timing of execution for both transaction should be same.
3. Admin's transaction should execute first followed by user's transaction
4.  User needs to provide msg.value that satisfies both initial and final index. 

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls `removeMarketConfig` with index of 5 let's say
2. At the same time, user calls `createMarketWithConfig` with index 5.
3. Admin's transaction executed first, followed by user's transaction
4. User gets configuration of last index of the array instead of 5. 

### Impact

If user is getting a configuration that requires more ether, then user is losing money that way. 
Suppose for index 5 you needed 5 ether and for last index you need 6 ether. If user pays 6 ether during the call , then technically he lost 1 ether. 

This is a valid medium because it follows Sherlock's criteria for validity 

> 1. Causes a loss of funds but requires certain external conditions or specific states, or a loss is highly constrained. The loss must be relevant to the affected party.
> 2. Users lose more than 0.01% and more than $10 of their principal.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use a mapping data structure instead along with the struct, so that index can be disabled just by changing a boolean in that mapping.
