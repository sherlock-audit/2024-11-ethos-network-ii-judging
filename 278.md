# Wrong comments lead to potential risks

### Summary

There are incorrect comments in several parts of the code regarding key values and variables. While this may seem non-critical, it poses potential risks during development due to the importance of accurate documentation.

### Root Cause

In [EthosVouch.sol#L166-L170](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L166C3-L170C91):

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Maps subject profile IDs and vouch IDs to their index in the vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId array
 * @dev authorProfileId => subjectProfileId => vouchId    @audit-issue subjectProfileId => vouchId => vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId Index
 */
mapping(uint256 => mapping(uint256 => uint256)) public vouchIdsForSubjectProfileIdIndex;
```

In [Reputation.sol#L219-L253](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L219C5-L253C7):

```solidity
// Default tier
// - Minimum viable liquidity for small/new markets
// - 0.002 ETH initial liquidity        //@audit-issue 0.02 ETH initial liquidity
// - 1 vote each for trust/distrust (volatile price at low volume)
marketConfigs.push(
  MarketConfig({
    initialLiquidity: 2 * DEFAULT_PRICE,
    initialVotes: 1,
    basePrice: DEFAULT_PRICE
  })
);

// Deluxe tier
// - Moderate liquidity for established profiles
// - 0.05 ETH initial liquidity         //@audit-issue 0.5 ETH initial liquidity
// - 1,000 votes each for trust/distrust (moderate price stability)
marketConfigs.push(
  MarketConfig({
    initialLiquidity: 50 * DEFAULT_PRICE,
    initialVotes: 1000,
    basePrice: DEFAULT_PRICE
  })
);

// Premium tier
// - High liquidity for stable price discovery
// - 0.1 ETH initial liquidity          //@audit-issue 1.0 ETH initial liquidity
// - 10,000 votes each for trust/distrust (highly stable price)
marketConfigs.push(
  MarketConfig({
    initialLiquidity: 100 * DEFAULT_PRICE,
    initialVotes: 10000,
    basePrice: DEFAULT_PRICE
  })
);
```
