# Incorrect modification of `marketFunds` in the `ReputationMarket.sellVotes()` function.

### Summary

In the `sellVotes()` function, `marketFunds` is decremented by `fundsReceived`, which doesn't include the fee amount paid. However, the fee amount should also be deducted from `marketFunds`.

### Root Cause

As shown in [line 522](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L522) of the `sellVotes()` function, `marketFunds` is decremented by `fundsReceived`.

```solidity
       function sellVotes(
         ...

         (
           uint256 votesSold,
505:       uint256 fundsReceived,
           ,
           uint256 protocolFee,
           uint256 minVotePrice,
           uint256 maxVotePrice
         ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);
     
         ...

517:     applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);
     
520:     _sendEth(fundsReceived);

522:     marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
         
         ...
       }
```

`fundsReceived` is calculated in the `_calculateSell()` function. This function determines the total price of selling votes and deducts fees (at line 1041) from it. Therefore, `fundsReceived` only represents the amount received by the seller. Consequently, fees should also be subtracted from `marketFunds`.

```solidity
        function _calculateSell(
          ...
      
          while (votesSold < amount) {
            if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
              revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
            }
      
            market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
            votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
1038:       fundsReceived += votePrice;
            votesSold++;
          }
1041:     (fundsReceived, protocolFee, ) = previewFees(fundsReceived, false);
          minPrice = votePrice;
      
          return (votesSold, fundsReceived, votePrice, protocolFee, minPrice, maxPrice);
        }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact

Incorrect modification of `marketFunds` results in a loss of funds for the protocol when withdrawing from the graduate market funds.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Subtract fee amount from `marketFunds`.
