# Admin can set more fee percentage than the one stated in the README.

### Summary

In the [README](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/675?filter=questions), the protocol stated that the maximum total fees of both contract cannot exceed 10%. 
```block
Are there any limitations on values set by admins (or other roles) in the codebase, including restrictions on array lengths?
...
For both contracts:
Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%
```

This is not true in EthosVouch.sol, as the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` variable is set to an incorrect amount.

### Root Cause

In EthosVouch.sol, the variable `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is used in the [checkFeeExceedsMaximum()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L996-L1004) function, which restrict admins from setting a bigger fee percentage point than intended.

```solidity 
  function checkFeeExceedsMaximum(uint256 currentFee, uint256 newFee) internal view {
    uint256 totalFees = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints +
      exitFeeBasisPoints +
      entryDonationFeeBasisPoints +
      entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints +
      newFee -
      currentFee;
    if (totalFees > MAX_TOTAL_FEES) revert FeesExceedMaximum(totalFees, MAX_TOTAL_FEES);
  }
```

However, the [variable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120) is set to `10000` basis points instead of  `1000`.

```solidity 
  uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
```

This allows the admin to set the fee basis point variables to exceed 10%, as the `BASIS_POINT_SCALE` is 10000.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Admin can set variables to collect excessive fees from user, more than what the protocol intended.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix the variable to reflect 10% and not 100%

```diff

-   uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
+   uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000;
