# Malicious users can simply avoid slashing by immediately unvouching after an infraction

### Summary

Users can `unvouch` as soon as they suspect or are aware of an infraction, archiving the vouch and making it ineligible for slashing.

### Root Cause

Users can instantly archive, slashing is mostly used where a stake is involved just like in this protocol, and the only way to effectively implement slashing is to enable a withdrawal delay, or to delay the time required to archive a vouch.

```solidity 
// Only slash active vouches
      if (!vouch.archived) {
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. user does something worthy of slashing which would cause, reputational or financial damage to the protocol and immediately calls unvouch.

2. except the condition for slashing are unstipulated, a user will know immediately after an infraction. and can quickly pull our their funds, incuring reputational damage for the protocol and going scott free due to this line

### Impact

Slashing cannot be implemented without some form of delay before unvouching.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add a withdrawal(unvouching) delay to check if a user can still be slashed.
