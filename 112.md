# Buyers lose a portion of remaining ETH due to wrong fees calculation

## Summary

During the purchase of votes, the buyer sends a certain amount of ETH and expects the smart contract to calculate the number of votes that can be bought and send the remaining balance back. However, the issue arises from the fact that fees are applied to the full amount sent, rather than the price of the votes being purchased.

## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the following scenario:
1. Vote price is 0.5 ETH, protocol fee is 5% and donation is 5%.
2. Buyer calls `buyVotes` and sends 1 ETH.
3. `_calculateBuy` will return 
   - `votesBought`: 1
   - `fundsPaid`: 0.6 ETH (0.5 is the price and 0.1 is 10% of 1 ETH)
4. Buyer receives refund of 0.4 ETH

However, as can clearly be seen from the initial values, the gross amount of 1 vote purchased should be: `0.5 + (0.5 Ã— 10%) = 0.55 ETH`. Therefore, the buyer should be refunded `0.45 ETH`. The lost amount due to the fee calculation issue in this example is` 0.05 ETH`.

```solidity
  function _calculateBuy(
    Market memory market,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 funds
  )
    private
    view
    returns (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      uint256 newVotePrice,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    )
  {
    uint256 fundsAvailable;
>>  (fundsAvailable, protocolFee, donation) = previewFees(funds, true);  // @audit ISSUE: `funds` == `msg.value` !!
    uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    // ... rest of the code skipped ...
  }
```


## Impact

Buyers lose a portion of their refunds. The amount lost depends on fee percentages, vote current price, and `msg.value`, and can be significant.

## Recommendation

Calculate fees based on the actual amount paid for the votes purchased.
