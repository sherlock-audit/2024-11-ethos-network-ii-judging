# Users should not be limited on the amount they can stake when calling `increaseVouch`

### Summary

The function `increaseVouch()` has a check for the  minimum vouch amount , which prevents one from vouching with a low amount. This makes sense when vouching for the first time but not when increasing the vouch. 

### Root Cause

In [EthosVouch.sol:426](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426-L444) we have the following check
```solidity
    if (msg.value < configuredMinimumVouchAmount) {
      revert MinimumVouchAmount(configuredMinimumVouchAmount);
    }
```
This prevents anyone from increasing the vouch with an amount less than the configured min amount. 
This check should only be done when we are making a new vouch and not when increasing an existing one, increasing the vouch should not limit the author on the amount.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

An author cannot increase their vouch if they have very small amount left. To do this they would be forced to withdraw their current stake

### Mitigation

```solidity
  function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable nonReentrant whenNotPaused {
    
    // get the profile id of the author
    uint256 profileId = IEthosProfile(
      contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
    ).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);
    _vouchShouldBelongToAuthor(vouchId, profileId);
    // make sure this vouch is active; not unvouched
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);

    uint256 subjectProfileId = vouches[vouchId].subjectProfileId;
    (uint256 toDeposit, ) = applyFees(msg.value, true, subjectProfileId);
    vouches[vouchId].balance += toDeposit;

    emit VouchIncreased(vouchId, profileId, subjectProfileId, msg.value);
  }
```
