# Users may pay unexpected fees because admins can change fee rates while buying and selling is active

## Vulnerability Details

Although the admin is trusted, when the admin wants to change protocol fees or donation fees, they can only do this while the contract is unpaused via the set functions. This means users can still submit transactions to buy/sell votes during this time. The issue is that users may submit transactions expecting one fee rate, but end up paying a different (higher) rate if the admin changes the fees before their transaction goes through.

The admin has no way to know about all pending transactions. And since Base uses a private sequencer, there's no way to reliably know what order transactions will execute in.

## POC

Here's a simple example:

1. Alice wants to buy 1 vote for 1 ETH. She sees the current fees are:

   - Protocol fee (`entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints`) : 3% (0.03 ETH)
   - Donation fee (`donationBasisPoints`) : 3% (0.03 ETH)
     She's okay with paying these fees.

2. The admin increases both fees to 5% while the contract is unpaused.

3. If Alice's transaction processes after the fee increase, she'll end up paying:
   - Protocol fee (`entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints`) : (0.05 ETH)
   - Donation fee (`donationBasisPoints`) : (0.05 ETH)

This is 0.04 ETH more in fees than she expected (4% more of her principal of 1 ETH) which fits into medium severity

## Impact

Users may unexpectedly pay higher fees than they expected to, losing up to a few percent more of their principal.

## Recommendation

The admin should only be able to change fees while the contract is paused. This prevents any buy/sell transactions from going through during fee changes. Add the `whenPaused` modifier instead of `whenNotPaused` to the fee-setting functions.
