# Unexpected Fund Reduction When Vouching for a Profile

## Summary
When a user (e.g., Alice) vouches for a profileId, part of her vouched amount is allocated to the previous voucher for the same profile. This creates a vulnerability where an attacker (e.g., Bob) can front-run Alice's transaction, becoming the prior voucher, and taking a higher fee from Alice than she anticipated.

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L330-L334
The function lacks a slippage protection check, leaving Alice vulnerable to unexpected reductions in her vouched amount due to front-running.
## Impact
Users may lose confidence in the protocol due to unpredictable fund reductions, which could harm the protocol's reputation and adoption.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
  function vouchByProfileId(
	uint256 subjectProfileId,
	string calldata comment,
	string calldata metadata
) public payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    ...
}
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a slippage check in vouchByProfileId, allowing users to specify a minimum toDeposit amount. Revert the transaction if the actual deposit falls below this minimum.
