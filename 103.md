# Protocol fee loss or overpayment due to exit fee adjustments

### Summary

When users call [EthosVouch::unvouch()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L452-L481), they are required to pay exit fees. However, since the amount is calculated using the `exitFeeBasisPoints` value at the time of unvouching, the total fee the user has to pay can exceed the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` limit. Additionally, the protocol might earn no fees at all due to this issue.

The `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` [is intended to be capped at `10%`](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/675?filter=questions#:~:text=Maximum%20total%20fees%20cannot%20exceed%2010%25), but this is currently not the case due to an error made by the sponsor. For the purposes of this report, I will proceed with `MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000`. However, even if this was not an issue, the problem would persist.

### Root Cause

Currently, it is ensured that the sum of all fees does not exceed `MAX_TOTAL_FEES`. However, users may still end up paying more than the maximum fees intended by the protocol when they call `EthosVouch::unvouch()`. This is because the exit fees are calculated at the time of unvouching rather than at the time of vouching. As a result, the exit fee could have increased, leading to `entryFees + exitFee` exceeding `MAX_TOTAL_FEES`. Additionally, due to this issue, the protocol might earn less

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. The fee values are initially set as follows:
`entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints = 1000`
`entryDonationFeeBasisPoints = 0`
`entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints = 0`
`exitFeeBasisPoints = 0`
2. A user calls `EthosVouch::vouchByProfileId()` to vouch for a ProfileId sending `11 ETH` in the transaction. This is because they intend to vouch `10 ETH` and need to pay a 10% fee.
3. A few days later, the admin changes `entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints` to `0` and `exitFeeBasisPoints` to `1000`. It is important to note that the exact values are not critical—any **increase** in `exitFeeBasisPoints` can trigger this issue.
4. The user (voucher) calls `EthosVouch::unvouch()` to remove their vouch and is required to pay exit fees. These exit fees are calculated as 10% of the vouched amount. Consequently, the total fees exceed `MAX_TOTAL_FEES`.

If the changes are made the other way around, the protocol loses fees:

1. The fee values are initially set as follows:
`entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints = 0`
`entryDonationFeeBasisPoints = 0`
`entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints = 0`
`exitFeeBasisPoints = 1000`
2. A user calls `EthosVouch::vouchByProfileId()` to vouch for a ProfileId sending `10 ETH` in the transaction.
3. A few days later, the admin changes `entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints` to `1000` and `exitFeeBasisPoints` to `0`. It is important to note that the exact values are not critical—any **decrease** in `exitFeeBasisPoints` can trigger this issue.
4. The user (voucher) calls `EthosVouch::unvouch()` to remove their vouch and is required to pay exit fees. These exit fees are calculated as 0% of the vouched amount. Consequently, the user does not pay any fees (neither for vouching nor for unvouching).

### Impact

If the `exitFeeBasisPoints` increased between vouching and unvouching, users might have to pay more than `MAX_TOTAL_FEES`. If `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` were set to `1000`, they could end up paying a maximum of 10% of the `msg.value` from the vouch transaction, plus an additional 10% of the vouched amount when they call `EthosVouch::unvouch()`.

If the `exitFeeBasisPoints` decreased between vouching and unvouching, the protocol could lose fees. In the worst case, the protocol might earn no fees at all.

An admin does not need to be malicious for this issue to occur, as **any** change in `exitFeeBasisPoints` at **any** time could trigger either the voucher paying too many fees or the protocol earning less fees. It is expected that admins will adjust the fee settings.

### PoC

The following test is to verify the first attack path and should be added to `EthosVouch.test.ts`:

```solidity
it('should pay more than max fees', async () => {
  const {
    ethosProfile,
    ethosVouch,
    ADMIN,
    OWNER,
    PROFILE_CREATOR_1,
    VOUCHER_0,
    FEE_PROTOCOL_ACC,
  } = await loadFixture(deployFixture);
  
  await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(PROFILE_CREATOR_1.address);
  await ethosProfile.connect(PROFILE_CREATOR_1).createProfile(1);

  await ethosProfile.connect(OWNER).inviteAddress(VOUCHER_0.address);
  await ethosProfile.connect(VOUCHER_0).createProfile(1);
  
  expect(await ethosProfile.profileIdByAddress(PROFILE_CREATOR_1.address)).to.be.equal(
    2,
    'wrong profile Id',
  );
        
  // set protocol fee to 1000
  await ethosVouch.connect(ADMIN).setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints(1000);

  expect(await ethosVouch.entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints()).to.be.equal(
    1000,
    'wrong entry protocol fee',
  );

  const feeBalanceBeforeVouch = await ethers.provider.getBalance(FEE_PROTOCOL_ACC.address);
        
  await ethosVouch.connect(VOUCHER_0).vouchByProfileId(2, DEFAULT_COMMENT, DEFAULT_METADATA, {
    value: ethers.parseEther('1.1'),
  });

  const feeBalanceAfterVouch = await ethers.provider.getBalance(FEE_PROTOCOL_ACC.address);
  const feeBalanceDifferenceVouch = feeBalanceAfterVouch - feeBalanceBeforeVouch;

  expect(feeBalanceDifferenceVouch)
    .to.equal(100000000000000000n, 'Wrong entry protocol fee');

  // set protocol fee to 0
  await ethosVouch.connect(ADMIN).setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints(0);

  expect(await ethosVouch.entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints()).to.be.equal(
    0,
    'wrong entry protocol fee',
  );

  // set exit fee to 1000
  await ethosVouch.connect(ADMIN).setExitFeeBasisPoints(1000);

  expect(await ethosVouch.exitFeeBasisPoints()).to.be.equal(
    1000,
    'wrong exit fee',
  );

  const feeBalanceBeforeUnvouch = await ethers.provider.getBalance(FEE_PROTOCOL_ACC.address);

  await ethosVouch.connect(VOUCHER_0).unvouch(0);

  const feeBalanceAfterUnvouch = await ethers.provider.getBalance(FEE_PROTOCOL_ACC.address);
  const feeBalanceDifferenceUnvouch = feeBalanceAfterUnvouch - feeBalanceBeforeUnvouch;

  expect(feeBalanceDifferenceUnvouch)
    .to.equal(90909090909090910n, 'Wrong exit fee');

  // this is more than 10% of the inital msg.value in the vouchByProfileId() transaction
  // i.e. more than the supposed MAX_TOTAL_FEES
  expect(feeBalanceDifferenceVouch + feeBalanceDifferenceUnvouch)
    .to.equal(190909090909090910n, 'Wrong fee amount');
});
```

### Mitigation

Consider calculating the exit fee when a user vouches and charge that amount when the user calls `EthosVouch::unvouch()` instead of calculating it using the `exitFeeBasisPoints` value at the timestamp of unvouching.
