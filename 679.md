# Maximum total fees will exceed 10% and invariant is broken

### Summary

Readme clearly states
_For both contracts:_

_Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%_

However, it does exceed 10%:
`uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000; // 100%`

### Root Cause

There's a wrongly assigned constant here:
