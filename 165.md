# DEFAULT_PRICE is Misassigned

### Summary

The value of `DEFAULT_PRICE` appears to be misassigned, as certain operations under the NatSpec do not match the current implementation.

### Root Cause

* [ReputationMarket.sol#L79](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L79)
* [ReputationMarket.sol#L221](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L221)
* [ReputationMarket.sol#L225](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L225)


In the NatSpec for the default tier, we can read:

> 0.002 ETH initial liquidity

This is 10 times smaller than the current implementation:

> 2 * DEFAULT_PRICE

This also applies to the Deluxe and Premium Tiers.
