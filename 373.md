# Front-Running Vulnerability

### Summary

An author might exploit a timing vulnerability by front-running the unvouch function after the slash function is called, allowing them to archive the vouch and avoid slashing penalties.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L530

The vulnerability arises from the ability to execute transactions in a specific order, where the author can prioritize their unvouch transaction to be processed before the slash transaction, using higher gas fees to influence transaction ordering.

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Slash Initiation: The slashing process is triggered due to a breach of contract rules or unethical behavior.
Front-Running: The author submits an unvouch transaction with a higher gas fee, ensuring it is processed before the slashing transaction.
Archiving: The unvouch function executes, archiving the vouch and preventing the slashing from taking effect.


### Impact


Penalty Evasion: Authors can withdraw their stake and avoid financial penalties, undermining the contract's deterrent mechanisms.
