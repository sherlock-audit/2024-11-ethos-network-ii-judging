# High market volatility may cause unexpected losses for sellers on the Base network.

### Summary

The absence of a slippage check in the `sellVotes` function can lead to sellers receiving significantly less than expected due to MEV opportunities arising from natural market conditions. This occurs because transaction ordering and execution on Base Layer 2 can be affected by network congestion and high transaction volume, which introduces delays and price fluctuations that sellers cannot control.

### Root Cause

The missing slippage check in `sellVotes` exposes sellers to price volatility. Unlike public mempools in Layer 1, Base's private sequencer architecture means users cannot front-run transactions directly. However, natural MEV can still occur due to:

1. Batch transaction processing: The sequencer processes transactions in batches, which can cause price updates between submission and execution.
2. High network congestion: During periods of intense market activity, delays in transaction execution can lead to significant price changes.
3. Prioritization rules: Transactions might be ordered based on fee prioritization during congestion, even if not maliciously, causing unpredictable execution times.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A seller submits a `sellVotes()` transaction based on the current price.
2. Vote price fluctuates due to other transactions being processed in the same batch or just before the seller’s transaction.

### External pre-conditions

1. Network congestion or high activity in the marketplace leads to delays in transaction processing.
2. Sequencer processes transactions in batches, causing price updates after transaction submission but before execution.
3. Fee-based prioritization may influence transaction order during peak activity, affecting when the seller’s transaction is executed.

### Attack Path

Natural MEV:

1. A seller submits a `sellVotes()` transaction, expecting a specific payout based on the vote price at the time of submission.
2. As the market experiences high activity, many buy and sell transactions are processed, causing price volatility.
3. The sequencer executes transactions in batches, and the price shifts before the seller's transaction is executed.
4. The seller’s transaction executes at a lower price, resulting in a reduced payout.

### Impact

Sellers can suffer significant financial losses due to receiving lower-than-expected payouts. The lack of slippage protection makes this a systemic risk in volatile markets, particularly during periods of high network congestion and transaction surges. This creates a poor user experience and potential loss of confidence in the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a slippage tolerance parameter in the `sellVotes()` function, similar to the one in `buyVotes`. This would allow sellers to specify the minimum acceptable payout, ensuring the transaction reverts if the price deviates beyond their tolerance.
