# Ineffective Reward Allocation for Profiles Without Existing Vouchers

### Summary

A logical design flaw in the reward distribution mechanism will cause potential fee loss for the protocol as the current implementation fails to handle scenarios with zero existing vouchers

### Root Cause

In `EthosVouch.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L714-L717 the `_rewardPreviousVouchers()` function lacks a proper handling mechanism when no previous vouchers are present

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Total balance of vouchers for a specific profile is zero
2. Reward or fee is attempted to be distributed
3. No existing voucher holders for the profile

### External pre-conditions

1. Sufficient rewards/fees available for distribution
2. Profile has been created but not yet had any voucher activity

### Attack Path

1. Reward distribution function is called for a new profile
2. Function detects zero total balance
3. Immediate return without processing the reward
4. Passed reward amount remains undistributed
5. Potential permanent loss of protocol fees

### Impact

The protocol suffers from:

- Potential permanent loss of protocol fees
- Inconsistent reward allocation mechanism
- No clear recovery path for undistributed rewards
- Reduced financial efficiency for new or inactive profiles

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the reward distribution logic to handle zero-balance scenarios 

```solidity 

// Before (Vulnerable)
if (totalBalance == 0) {
   return totalBalance;
}

// After (Corrected)
if (totalBalance == 0) {
   _depositProtocolFee(amount);  // Transfer to protocol treasury
   return 0;
}
```
