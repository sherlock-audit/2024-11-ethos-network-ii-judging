# No slippage check in `sellVotes` can cause users to receive less ETH than expected.

### Summary

`ReputationMarket.sellVotes` should have a slippage check to avoid unnecessary fund loss.

### Root Cause

In [sellVotes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495). When the user submits a transaction the price of 1 vote is 0.5ETH, and Here the user is expecting 0.5 ETH in return but if there is some other transaction in mempool that is selling the vote, it decreases the price of 1 vote to 0.1 ETH, Now after this transaction user will now only receive 0.1 ETH instead of 0.5 for their 1 vote.

```solidity
function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // calculate the amount of votes to sell and the funds received
    (
      uint256 votesSold,
      uint256 fundsReceived,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);

    // update the market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;

    // apply protocol fees
    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

    // send the proceeds to the seller
    _sendEth(fundsReceived);
    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
    emit VotesSold(
      profileId,
      msg.sender,
      isPositive,
      votesSold,
      fundsReceived,
      block.timestamp,
      minVotePrice,
      maxVotePrice
    );
    _emitMarketUpdate(profileId);
  }

```

Note this is not a frontrunning attack(it is not possible in base) but this is a race condition scenario which will lead to the loss for the seller eventually.

### Internal pre-conditions

none

### External pre-conditions

 mempool should have multiple sell orders(which is very likely). 

### Attack Path

1. The user calls `sellVotes`function to sell 1 vote at 0.5 ETH. 
2. There is already a sellVotes transaction in the mempool. 
3.  The first transaction modifies the price of 1 vote to 0.1 ETH.
4. user transaction gets executed
5. user receives 0.1 ETH instead of 0.5 ETH.

### Impact

Because the user doesnâ€™t have full control of his transaction he may not receive what he desired. 

### PoC

none

### Mitigation

add `minAmountOut` as a param to the function and check it against `fundsReceived`, if minAmountOur is less than fundsReceived then revert.
