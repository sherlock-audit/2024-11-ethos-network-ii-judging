# Corruptible upgradability pattern in EthosVouch and ReputationMarket

### Summary

The EthosVouch and ReputationMarket contracts are UUPSUpgradeable but have issues regarding upgradability and initialization that could lead to storage corruption and potential reentrancy vulnerabilities.

### Root Cause

1. Using non-upgradeable version of `ReentrancyGuard`:
```solidity
import { ReentrancyGuard } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
contract EthosVouch is AccessControl, UUPSUpgradeable, ITargetStatus, ReentrancyGuard
```
```solidity
import { ReentrancyGuard } from "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol";
contract ReputationMarket is AccessControl, UUPSUpgradeable, ReentrancyGuard
```
2. Neither contract implements storage gaps to protect against storage collision in future upgrades
3. Even if switched to ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable, the contracts don't initialize it in their initializers, which could break reentrancy protection on functions handling ETH transfers

### Internal pre-conditions

If admin performs an upgrade and wants to add another storage slot in any of these contracts, the storage slots would collide and become corrupted.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Storage of `EthosVouch` and `ReputationMarket` contracts will be corrupted during upgrading
Lack of reentrancy protection on functions handling ETH transfers

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace ReentrancyGuard with ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable : [OpenZeppelin Contracts Upgradeable](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/tree/master)
Add storage gaps
Initialize the reentrancy guard
