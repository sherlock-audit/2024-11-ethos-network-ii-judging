# Corruptible storage pattern

### Summary

Both contracts in scope inherit contracts which also inherit more contracts. This structure increases the complexity, and upon upgrade of any contracts in the middle will potentially corrupt storage states. While the problematic contract, `AccessControl` is not in scope, but two contracts all extends from it.

### Root Cause

Both `EthosVouch` and `ReputationMarket` inherit `AccessControl`, which itself also extends from `PausableUpgradeable` and `AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable`. `AccessControl` does not have a `_gap` variable, and when it's being upgraded, it can very well affect the state of `EthosVouch` and `ReputationMarket`.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Storage can be corrupted due to lack of `_gap`

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add `_gap` to `AccessControl`
