# Incorrect Exit Fee Calculation in `applyFees()`

### Summary

The `EthosVouch.applyFees()` function incorrectly calculates the exit fee based on withdrawable amount ()`toWithdraw`) instead of the intended base amount (`vouch.balance`). This inconsistency deviates from the design constraints, leading to an incorrect overall fee structure.


### Root Cause

1. The `EthosVouch.checkFeeExceedsMaximum()` function enforces the condition that the sum of all fees (`entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints`, `entryDonationFeeBasisPoints`, `entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints`, and `exitFeeBasisPoints`) must not exceed `100%`:

This means that the entry fees and the exit fee should be calculated based on the same quantity.
2. The `applyFees()` function calculates the entry fees based on the `vouch.balance`. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L936-L938
However, the function calculates the exit fee based on the withdrawable amount:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L955
    ```solidity
        uint256 exitFee = calcFee(amount, exitFeeBasisPoints);
    ```
    where amount equals the remaining balance of the vouch after deducting entry fees. This results in the exit fee being computed on a reduced base, violating the intended constraints.

### Attack Path

1. The administrator sets:
    - `entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints = 5000` (`50%`),
    - `entryDonationFeeBasisPoints = entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints = 0`,
    - `exitFeeBasisPoints = 5000` (`50%`).
    The total sum of fee rates are `100%`.
2. A user vouches `9000`. Entry fees are calculated as:
    - Entry fee: `9000 * 5000 / (10000 + 5000) = 3000`
    - Remaining vouch's balance: `9000 - 3000 = 6000`
3. Upon unvouching, exit fee is calculated as:
    - Exit fee: `6000 * 5000 / (10000 + 5000) = 2000`
    - Withdrawable amount: `6000 - 2000 = 4000`
4. Total fees amount to `3000 + 2000 = 5000`, which is `5000 / 6000 = 83%` of the vouch's balance instead of the expected `100%`.


### Impact

The miscalculation:
- Results in fees deviating from the intended design, creating discrepancies in the system's fee structure.
- Allows the sum of entry and exit fees to exceed or fall short of 100%, undermining user trust and system consistency.

### Mitigation

Update the exit fee calculation in the `applyFees()` function to use the correct base (`vouch.balance`):
```solidity
-     uint256 exitFee = calcFee(amount, exitFeeBasisPoints);
+     uint256 exitFee = amount * exitFeeBasisPoints / BASIS_POINT_SCALE;
```
This change ensures that the exit fee aligns with the design constraints, maintaining consistent fee calculations.
