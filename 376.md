# Wrong rounding in `_calcVotePrice` will lead to insolvency

### Summary
A vote's price gets calculated by the following formula

```solidity
  function _calcVotePrice(Market memory market, bool isPositive) private pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalVotes = market.votes[TRUST] + market.votes[DISTRUST];
    return (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] * market.basePrice) / totalVotes;
  }
```

As we can see the vote's price is rounded down (due to Solidity's built-in rounding down). Considering the formula calculates the true price of a vote, the actual paid one would be just slightly lower. Given enough bought votes, rounding down will be enough wei.

Then, depending on the order they're sold, the rounding down on each step, might be lower. This would cause more funds to be sent during sales, than were taken initially. This would then break the following invariant from the ReadMe 
> They must never pay out the initial liquidity deposited.

Note: currently, the bonding curve formula is flawed, so issue cannot be showcased on itself. However, the formula being broken and not rounding up are two separate issues, hence why I've reported them as such. 


### Root Cause

Rounding in wrong direction

### Attack Path
1. User buys a certain combination of T/D votes in a certain order. Due to rounding down they purchase them for 5 wei less than the true price
2. User then sells them in a different order, due to which, less rounding down occurs, therefore they're sold at higher price than the one bought at. 
3. A few wei of market's initial liquidity is distributed to users.

### Impact
Distributing initial liquidity.

### Mitigation

Round up within the vote's price formula
