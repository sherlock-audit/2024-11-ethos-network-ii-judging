# Who should the dust(remaining rewards due to rounding) of the voucher pool be sent to?

### Summary

In the function applyFees(), the donation Fee is used to reward the profile.

In the _rewardPreviousVouchers() function, the dust from the pool fee is also used to reward the profile. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L735

I think you need not to reward profiles with dust(remaining rewards due to rounding) of the voucher pool since the donation fee is used to reward profiles.
My suggestion is to add the dust to the toDeposit variable of the applyFee() function.
This is because the primary purpose is deposits, not rewards.
