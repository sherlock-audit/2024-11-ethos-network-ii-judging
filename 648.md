# Reentrancy in `ReputationMarket::withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` function

### Summary

Attacker can drain the ReputationMarket smart contract funds by exploiting the reentrancy vulnerability in [`ReputationMarket::withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L660C1-L678C4) function.

### Root Cause

In `ReputationMarket::withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` function, there is no reentrancy protection and `Ethers` are sent to `msg.sender` before resetting the `marketFunds` mapping

```solidity
  function withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(uint256 profileId) public whenNotPaused {
    ....SNIP
@>  _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]);
    emit MarketFundsWithdrawn(profileId, msg.sender, marketFunds[profileId]);
@>  marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
  }
```

When the funds are sent, the execution flow goes back to `msg.sender` because this function is not reentrancy protected, `msg.sender` can recall this function.

### Internal pre-conditions

In `ContractAddressManager` a malicious address is added as authorizedAddress for `GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL`. However, it is mentioned in contest details that `Graduate` is assumed to be contract that is deployed and owned by Ethos, it is not guaranteed that this ownable contract is 100% hack proof. 

While developing a smart contract, we need to adopt "worst comes first" mentality and make our smart contract battle tested and fully secured.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. There is a market in which graduate funds are available for withdrawal
2. Attacker (being a smart contract and assumed the role of authorizedAddress) calls `ReputationMarket::withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` function
3. `Ethers` are sent to this malicious attacker contract, and during the execution, in the fallback function of malicious contract, `ReputationMarket::withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` function is recalled
4. Because `marketFunds` mapping is not reset yet `Ethers` will be sent again to malicious contract
5. Attacker can keep calling this function until the protocol is drained

### Impact

`ReputationMarket` funds can be drained completely.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

`ReputationMarket::withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` function should be modified as below:

```diff
  function withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(uint256 profileId) public whenNotPaused {
    address authorizedAddress = contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(
      "GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL"
    );
    if (msg.sender != authorizedAddress) {
      revert UnauthorizedWithdrawal();
    }
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);
    if (!graduatedMarkets[profileId]) {
      revert MarketNotGraduated();
    }
    if (marketFunds[profileId] == 0) {
      revert InsufficientFunds();
    }

++  marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
    _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]);
    emit MarketFundsWithdrawn(profileId, msg.sender, marketFunds[profileId]);
--  marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
  }
```
