# Users can increase vouch when EthosVouch is paused

### Summary

The [`EthosVouch::increaseVouch()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426) lacks the `whenNotPaused` modifier. This allows users to increase for an existing vouch even when the contract is paused.
