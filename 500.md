# the `protocolFee` should get decreased from `marketFunds[]` when user sell votes

### Summary

The values inside `marketFunds[]` are incorrect, because the value of `protocolFee` has not decreased.

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket.sol#sellVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L522) only decrease the tally market funds by `fundsReceived`
 `marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;`
 However, in the same transaction the `fundsReceived` is sent out to the user, but there is also the `protocolFee` is transferred to the `protocolFeeAddress` (check the sub-call to `applyFees()`), Both of these two values are actually from the same `profileId` 
 check `_calculateSell()`
 ```solidity
     (fundsReceived, protocolFee, ) = previewFees(fundsReceived, false);
 ```
 So, just subtracting `fundsReceived` from `marketFunds[profileId]` is not enough to keep the total market funds tracking correctly

### Attack Path

1- Every time the user calls `sellVotes()` the value of `marketFunds[]` will decreased less than it should
2- At some point, the `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()` will withdraw all that funds from a graduated market

### Impact

The `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()` will withdraw more funds than it should from the `ReputationMarket.sol` contract, leaving the contract in a deficit.

### Mitigation

After all, users sell the vote `marketFunds[profileId]` should only have the initial liquidity
So, you can update this line 
```diff
- marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
+ marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived + protocolFee;
```
