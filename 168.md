# Authors cannot withdrawal rewards leading to failure of slash and reward allocation

### Summary

The EthosVouch contract's reward withdrawal mechanism forces guarantors to cancel their guarantees (`unvouch`) to claim rewards, as no independent `rewards` mapping storage exists. This design couples rewards with guarantee states, leading to unnecessary cancellations, obsolete `vouches`, and increased gas costs during mapping traversals. Exploitable vulnerabilities such as storage inflation and repeated `unvouch` loops further exacerbate system inefficiencies and failure in slash and reward allocation. Mitigating this issue requires decoupling rewards from staking balances, enabling guarantors to claim rewards independently while optimizing storage and gas usage.

### Root Cause

The reward withdrawal mechanism in the EthosVouch contract is tightly coupled with the guarantee state. As a result, guarantors (authors) can only withdraw their rewards by calling the `unvouch` function, which cancels their guarantee. This design forces guarantors to `unvouch` in order to claim their rewards, leading to a buildup of obsolete vouches in the `vouches` mapping. Over time, this increases the gas cost of traversing the `vouches` mapping, potentially causing transactions to fail due to excessive gas consumption.

```solidity

        Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];
        if (!vouch.archived) {
            uint256 reward = amount.mulDiv(vouch.balance, totalBalance, Math.Rounding.Floor);
            if (reward > 0) {
                vouch.balance += reward;
                remainingRewards -= reward;
            }
        }
    }

**ClaimRewards Isolated for Subjects**

### Internal pre-conditions

1. **Fee Application:**  
   The `applyFees` function distributes a portion of fees (vouchers pool fee) to guarantors based on their vouch balance. Early guarantors receive a larger share.

2. **Reward Storage:**  
   Rewards for guarantors are stored directly in their `voucher.balance`, unlike the `rewards` mapping used for subjects. This prevents rewards from being withdrawn independently.

3. **Forced Withdrawal:**  
   Guarantors must use `unvouch` to withdraw their rewards. This increases obsolete `vouches` entries, leading to:
   - High gas costs when traversing `vouches`.
   - Lost first-mover advantage for rewards due to repeated re-vouching.

### External pre-conditions

1. **User Conditions:**  
   - The user must be a guarantor.  
   - The guarantee must be active.  
   - Unclaimed rewards must exist.

2. **Network Conditions:**  
   - The contract must not be paused.  
   - Gas prices should be reasonable.

### Attack Path

1. **Storage Inflation Attack**  
   Attackers create excessive, low-value guarantees, bloating the `vouches` mapping.
   ```solidity
   for (uint i = 0; i < MAX_VOUCHES; i++) {
       vouch(targetProfile, MINIMUM_AMOUNT);
   }
   ```

2. **Forced Reward Withdrawal**  
   Users repeatedly `unvouch` to claim rewards, then immediately re-vouch.  
   ```solidity
   function extractRewards() {
       unvouch(vouchId); // Withdraw rewards
       vouch(targetProfile, amount); // Re-vouch
   }
   ```

3. **Gas-Intensive Traversal**  
   Traversing bloated `vouches` consumes excessive gas, increasing failure risk.
   ```solidity
   for (uint i = 0; i < vouches.length; i++) {
       // Iterate over vouches
   }
   ```

### Impact

**Technical Impact**  
   - Increased gas costs.  
   - failure in Slash and reward allocation


### PoC

```solidity
contract EthosVouchTest {
    function testStorageInflation() public {
        EthosVouch vouch = new EthosVouch();
        
        // Create multiple guarantees
        for (uint i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
            vouch.vouchByProfileId{value: 0.1 ether}(
                targetProfileId,
                "",
                ""
            );
        }
        
        // Accumulate rewards
        // Wait for other users to generate rewards
        
        // Calculate storage cost
        uint gasCost = 0;
        for (uint i = 0; i < vouch.vouchCount(); i++) {
            gasCost += gasCostToAccessVouch(i);
        }
        
        assert(gasCost > THRESHOLD);
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

**Separate Reward Mechanism**  
Decouple rewards from the guarantee balance by storing them in a separate mapping or allowing users to choose between storing rewards and staking balances separately.
