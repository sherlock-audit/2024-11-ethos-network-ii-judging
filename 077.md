# The author `vouch.balance` locked forever

### Summary
The profile unable to withdraw their `vouch.balance`, due to an unexpected check.
### Root Cause
Consider that a `profileId` is created and managed by an organization. This `profileId` is associated with a list of `addresses[]` responsible for managing the profile across the Ethos ecosystem, including the `headAddr`(address that created the profile).

```solidity
addresses= [headAddr, addr1, addr2, addr3]
profileIdByAddress[headAddr] == profileIdByAddress[addr1] == profileIdByAddress[addr2] == profileIdByAddress[addr3] == 10(say)    -----------------(1) 
```

The `addr2` is actively staking on `EthosVouch` contract as an `author` to earn rewards(from voucher pool) and to build a strong foundation of trust with other organizations(subjects) on behalf of its organization(author).

Let's say the `addr2` vouch for `subjectId==5`, the `vouches` states updates as

```solidity
  function vouchByProfileId(
    uint256 subjectProfileId,
    string calldata comment,
    string calldata metadata
  ) public payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    ...snip...

    vouchIdByAuthorForSubjectProfileId[authorProfileId][subjectProfileId] = count;    
    vouches[count] = Vouch({
      archived: false,
      unhealthy: false,
      authorProfileId: authorProfileId,       >> @audit set 10 
      authorAddress: msg.sender,              >> @audit set addr2 
      vouchId: count,
      balance: toDeposit,
      subjectProfileId: subjectProfileId,     //  5
      comment: comment,
      metadata: metadata,
      activityCheckpoints: ActivityCheckpoints({
        vouchedAt: block.timestamp,
        unvouchedAt: 0,
        unhealthyAt: 0
      })
    });
   
    emit Vouched(count, authorProfileId, subjectProfileId, msg.value);
    vouchCount++;
}
```
where the `vouches[X].authorAddress` is set to `addr2`. 


The protocol allows other members of the profile, such as `headAddr`, `addr1`, and `addr3`, to call `increaseVouch()` on behalf of the organization.

```solidity
  function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable nonReentrant {
    // vouch increases much also meet the minimum vouch amount
    if (msg.value < configuredMinimumVouchAmount) {
      revert MinimumVouchAmount(configuredMinimumVouchAmount);
    }
    // get the profile id of the author
    uint256 profileId = IEthosProfile(
      contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
    ).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);        >> @audit due to (1), this will pass
...snip...
```
However, it restricts the `unvouch()` function to `addr2` only. If other members attempt to call `unvouch()`, the txn reverts due to following check 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L459
```solidity
    if (vouches[vouchId].authorAddress != msg.sender) {
      revert AddressNotVouchAuthor(vouchId, msg.sender, vouches[vouchId].authorAddress);
    }
```
this is dangerous, under a condition where the profileAddress(`=addr2`) turns to be malignant, the organization(basically the `headAddr`) can delete or mark it compromised, thinking other members can `unvouch()` it also. This leads the vouch balance to locked forever in `EthosVouch` contract(neither the compromised `addr2` can withdraw it). 

### Impact
Due to restriction imposed on `unvouch()`, the profile funds locked forever in the `Vouch` contract.

### Mitigation
Similar to [`increaseVouch()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L432-L434), allow other addresses of the profile to `unvouch()`  also.
