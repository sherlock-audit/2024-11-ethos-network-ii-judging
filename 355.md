# Inadequate Fee Validation Allows Fees to Exceed 10%

### Summary

The incorrect configuration of MAX_TOTAL_FEES as 100% (10,000 basis points) instead of the intended 10% (1,000 basis points) allows total fees to exceed the stated 10% limit. As a result, the validation in the following code does not enforce the intended cap:

```solidity
if (totalFees > MAX_TOTAL_FEES) revert FeesExceedMaximum(totalFees, MAX_TOTAL_FEES);
```

### Root Cause

In [EthosVouch: 120](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120), `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is incorrectly set to 10000 (100%) instead of 1000 (10%), leading to invalid fee validation in [checkFeeExceedsMaximum](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L1003).

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Admin sets fees up to 100%, leveraging the incorrectly defined `MAX_TOTAL_FEES`.
2. Users interact with the contract, incurring excessive fees.
3. Unable to change `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` due to constant variable

### Impact

Users can be charged up to 100% in fees during vouching or withdrawal, leading to a complete loss of funds in extreme cases.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Correct `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` to `1000` Basis Points i.e 10%
