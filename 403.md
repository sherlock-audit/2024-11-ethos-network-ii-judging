# Lack ofr storage gaps in base contracts inherited by `EthosVouch` and `ReputationMarket` can cause storage conflicts during upgrades

### Summary

The `EthosVouch` and `ReputationMarket` contracts are both implemented as UUPSUpgradeable contracts, which are designed to support upgrades. However, they do not utilize the upgradeable version of OpenZeppelinâ€™s `ReentrancyGuard` library. This omission introduces the risk of storage conflicts during upgrades. 

Upgradeable contracts require a precise storage layout to ensure data integrity across different versions. OpenZeppelin's upgradeable libraries, including the upgradeable `ReentrancyGuard`, are specifically designed to handle this by replacing constructor logic with an `initializer` function and aligning storage slots to prevent conflicts. Without these safeguards, manual upgrades can inadvertently overwrite state variables, misaligned storage, or introduce unintended behavior.

Also, Both `AccessControl` and it's base contract `` also lack storage gaps.

### Root Cause

* Both the [`EthosVouch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L67) and [`ReputationMarket`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L36) use the non-upgradeable version of `ReentrancyGuard`.
* [`AccessControl`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/AccessControl.sol#L34) lacks storage gap
* [`SignatureControl`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/SignatureControl.sol#L15) lacks storage gap

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Upgrading the contracts without using OpenZeppelin's upgradeable ReentrancyGuard` risks storage conflicts, which can overwrite or corrupt critical state variables and could in turn lead to severe consequences.

### PoC

n/a

### Mitigation

* Use ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable and initialize it in the `initialize` function
* Add storage gaps to `AccessControl` and `SignatureControl`
