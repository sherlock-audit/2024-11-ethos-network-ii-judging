### Attack Path

- Let's take an example to understand this.
- A user wants to buy huge amount of tokens for a profile id whose connfig is of index 2
- Assume current voteprice = 0.005 ether , msg.value = 10 ether
- Now when he calls buy tokens function it would go inside _calculateBuy() and then enters into while loop
```solidity
function _calculateBuy(
    Market memory market,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 funds
  )
    private
    view
    returns (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      uint256 newVotePrice,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    )
  {
    uint256 fundsAvailable;
    (fundsAvailable, protocolFee, donation) = previewFees(funds, true);
    uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);

    uint256 minPrice = votePrice;
    uint256 maxPrice;

    if (fundsAvailable < votePrice) {
      revert InsufficientFunds();
    }

    while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
      fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
      fundsPaid += votePrice;
      votesBought++;

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    }
    fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;

    maxPrice = votePrice;

    return (votesBought, fundsPaid, votePrice, protocolFee, donation, minPrice, maxPrice);
  }
```
- So here now fundsAvailable = 10 ether and votePrice = 0.005 ether
- This while loop would revolve for 1400-1500 times according to example taken.
- And i calculated out of gas problem would start occuring from 800 iteration.
- So even if take less value than 10 ether then also the bug i possible the main requiremnt of the bug is the while loop should continue for more than 800 iteration.

### Impact

Users would not be able to buy big amount of tokens as the transaction would be DOSed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Limit while loop iteration such that DOS doesn't happen
