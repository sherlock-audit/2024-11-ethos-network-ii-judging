# `ReputationMarket::sellVotes` is missing slippage protection

### Summary

`ReputationMarket::sellVotes` is missing slippage protection, as opposed to `ReputationMarket::buyVotes`, which correctly uses slippage protection.

Selling votes must also allow users to set slippage protection, as the vote price can change prior to function execution, causing a loss of funds for users. 

Note that the private mempool of Base L2 can still create conditions where inadequate slippage can lead to loss of funds (i.e, high network congestion leading to delay in price changes)

### Root Cause

To determine the root cause, let's look at what happens when selling votes:

[ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L534](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L534)
```javascript
  function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // calculate the amount of votes to sell and the funds received
    (
      uint256 votesSold,
      uint256 fundsReceived,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);

    // update the market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;

    // apply protocol fees
    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

    // send the proceeds to the seller
@>  _sendEth(fundsReceived);
    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
    ...
  }
```

The internal [_calculateSell](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1003) calculates the votes sold and funds received by calling `_calcVotePrice` to determine the price of the votes being sold:

[ReputationMarket.sol#L912-L923](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L912-L923)
```javascript
  function _calcVotePrice(Market memory market, bool isPositive) private pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalVotes = market.votes[TRUST] + market.votes[DISTRUST];
    return (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] * market.basePrice) / totalVotes;
  }
```

We can see that the vote price is determined by `totalVotes` and `market.votes`, both which can change prior to function execution.

This means that the vote price can significantly decrease prior to a user's `sellVotes` function call, which will cause a loss of funds for them.

We can therefore determine that the root cause is missing slippage in `sellVotes`.

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. User sells votes via `sellVotes` function
2. Vote price decreases prior to execution (i.e, other transactions are executed first)
3. Users votes are sold and receives less funds than expected

### Impact

Loss of funds for users due to receiving less funds than expected from selling votes.

### PoC

Consider the following scenario (these numbers are hypothetical and allow for a simple example):

Assume `market.basePrice = 1 ETH`, `totalVotes = 10`, `market.votes[DISTRUST] = 2`, `market.votes[TRUST] = 5`.

Alice decides to sell her two `market.votes[TRUST]` votes by calling `sellVotes`, expecting to receive `5 * 1 ETH / 10 = 5e17 ETH`. (we will ignore protocol fee in this example for sake of simplicity.)

Before Alice's transaction is executed, Bob's transaction is executed first, where he is selling two `market.votes[TRUST]` votes.

This changes the market values to the following: `market.votes[TRUST] = 5 - 2 = 3`, and `totalvotes = 10 - 2 = 8`.

Alice's transaction is executed, and her votes are sold at a price of `3 * 1 ETH / 8 = 3.750e17 ETH`.

Alice loses `1.25e17 ETH` in this case. This is a simple example, the price discrepancy can be far greater, causing significant loss of funds to users.


### Mitigation

Allow users to specify slippage for `sellVotes`, such as `minAmountOut` slippage, where the user must receive at least that amount for selling their votes.
