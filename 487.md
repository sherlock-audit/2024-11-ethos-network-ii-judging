# Profile Market can get created with incorrect parameters

### Summary

Because of the Swapping mechanism when removing market config, the profile market can get initialized with incorrect parameters.

### Root Cause

Users can create their market for their profiles in Ethos, there are different market configs (currently 3), where the Admins can add or remove market configs when they need.

For the user to create his Market, he puts the index of the market config he wants to create his market with then he calls `ReputationMarket::createMarketWithConfig()`.

When admins remove a market from the array, they use a swapping mechanism, where when removing an element in the middle, they swap it with the last element them pop the last element.

[ReputationMarket.sol#L403-L406](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L403-L406)
```solidity
    uint256 lastIndex = marketConfigs.length - 1;
    if (configIndex != lastIndex) {
      marketConfigs[configIndex] = marketConfigs[lastIndex];
    }

    // Remove the last element
    marketConfigs.pop();
```

So when removing a config lets say at index `2` and we have `5` configs, the config with index `2` will get changed to the config at index `4`.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

- Admins remove a certain config
- User(s) is/are creating a market using the indexed config to get removed by admins

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Ethos Profile Market Will get created with incorrect parameters, rather than the parameters needed by the caller


### PoC

- There are `5` configs
- UserA is creating a market for his profile using index `2` (3rd)
- Admins Planned to remove than config and they fired a tx to remove it, which precedes UserA tx
- Removing for config at index `2` occur successfully, and now at index `2` the Market config params is that was at index `4`
- UserA market was created successfully, with incorrect parameters

When initializing (creating Profile Market) the money paid for initialization is paid, then this will cause.

- Paying more money than expected, OR Revert the tx if the initialization money increased and the user puts exactly the money needed  (this is fine)

- different `basePrice` than needed by the user
- different `initialVotes` than needed by the user

And the problem is that the Market can't get removed/changed once it is created.

### Mitigation

When creating a market pass `MarketConfig` parameter and check that the config at this index is the same as the configs requested by the user, so that in case of market parameters changed because of removing, the tx will revert because if misMatch Market Config.
