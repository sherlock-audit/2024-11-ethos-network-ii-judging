# checkFeeExceedsMaximum will never revert as MAX_TOTAL_FEES is 100%

### Summary

In EthosVouch.sol whenever a fee is set the checkFeeExceedsMaximum will never revert as the MAX_TOTAL_FEES is set to 100% instead of 10% as is stated in the documentation.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120

MAX_TOTAL_FEES is set to 100% instead of 10% so the check is broken
