# users can bypass slashing(upto 10% penalty) by simply calling unvouch()

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

The `EthosVouch` contract includes a slashing mechanism intended to penalize unethical behavior by reducing the vouch balances of a given author by a specified percentage(upto 10%). 

```solidity
function slash(
    uint256 authorProfileId,
    uint256 slashBasisPoints
  ) external onlySlasher whenNotPaused nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
    if (slashBasisPoints > MAX_SLASH_PERCENTAGE) {
      revert InvalidSlashPercentage();
    }

    uint256 totalSlashed;
    uint256[] storage vouchIds = vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId];

    for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchIds.length; i++) {
      Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];
      // Only slash active vouches
      if (!vouch.archived) 
        uint256 slashAmount = vouch.balance.mulDiv(
          slashBasisPoints,
          BASIS_POINT_SCALE,
          Math.Rounding.Floor
        );
        if (slashAmount > 0) {
          vouch.balance -= slashAmount;
          totalSlashed += slashAmount;
        }
      }
    }

    if (totalSlashed > 0) {
      // Send slashed funds to protocol fee address
      (bool success, ) = protocolFeeAddress.call{ value: totalSlashed }("");
      if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Slash transfer failed");
    }

    emit Slashed(authorProfileId, slashBasisPoints, totalSlashed);
    return totalSlashed;
  }

```

However, users can potentially bypass this penalty by unvouching (withdrawing their vouch) before the slashing is executed.
```solidity
function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
    _vouchShouldExist(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);
    // because it's $$$, you can only withdraw/unvouch to the same address you used to vouch
    // however, we don't care about the status of the address's profile; funds are always attached
    // to an address, not a profile
    if (vouches[vouchId].authorAddress != msg.sender) {
      revert AddressNotVouchAuthor(vouchId, msg.sender, vouches[vouchId].authorAddress);
    }

    v.archived = true;
    // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
    v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt = block.timestamp;
    // remove the vouch from the tracking arrays and index mappings
    
    _removeVouchFromArrays(v);

    // apply fees and determine how much is left to send back to the author
    (uint256 toWithdraw, ) = applyFees(v.balance, false, v.subjectProfileId);
    // set the balance to 0 and save back to storage
    v.balance = 0;
    // send the funds to the author
    // note: it sends it to the same address that vouched; not the one that called unvouch
    (bool success, ) = payable(v.authorAddress).call{ value: toWithdraw }("");
    if (!success) {
      revert FeeTransferFailed("Failed to send ETH to author");
    }

    emit Unvouched(v.vouchId, v.authorProfileId, v.subjectProfileId);
  }

```
as we can see the unvouch function set the `v.archived = true;`

 This allows them to avoid the intended penalty of up to 10% of their staked amount. Additionally, users can create a new vouch immediately after unvouching

### Attack Path

Example Scenario

1. Initial Vouch: User A creates a vouch for User B with a balance of 10 ETH.
2. Slash: A slasher verifies that user is malicious and has to reduce User A's vouch balance by 10% due to unethical behavior.
3. Unvouch Action: Before the slashing is executed, User A calls the `unvouch` function to withdraw their vouch, effectively archiving it.
4. Bypassing Slash: Since the slash function only applies to active vouches (!vouch.archived), User A's archived vouch is not affected by the slashing event.

### Impact

user can bypasing the slash penalty upto 10%

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce a lock period or delay period after vouching during which unvouching is not allowed. This would prevent users from quickly unvouching to avoid slashing.
