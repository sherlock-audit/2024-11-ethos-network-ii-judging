# Malicious users can pay less voucher fee

### Summary

The current implementation allows users to pay less voucher pool fee by repeatedly calling the increaseVouch function instead of making a single vouch, as their share in the pool increases each time they call increaseVouche so they receive a portion of voucher pool fee .

### Root Cause

The voucher pool fee is distributed across all vouches and is applied when either creating or increasing a vouch. When a user vouches with the minimum amount, they receive a portion of the voucher pool fee during the next increaseVouch call. By repeatedly calling increaseVouch instead of creating a single vouch with the full amount, the user can reduce the total voucher pool fee they pay, as they receive a portion of it (as a payback) each time increaseVouch is called. Additionally, with each subsequent call to increaseVouch, they receive a larger portion of the voucher pool fee in the next call.

### Attack Path

**Scenario Description:**

1. The total vouch balance for all vouchers in a profile is 10 ETH.
2. Alice wants to vouch for this profile with 100 ETH.
3. With a 10% voucher pool fee, Alice should pay 10 ETH as the voucher pool fee.
4. Instead of making the full vouch in one transaction, Alice vouches with the minimum amount (e.g., 10 ETH), paying only a 1 ETH fee.
5. Alice then calls `increaseVouch` with an additional 90 ETH. Since she owns 50% of the vouch balance, she receives 50% of the voucher pool fee.
6. A total of 9 ETH in voucher pool fees is applied, Alice receives 4.5 ETH of this amount ( payback ) since now she receives part of this fee.
7. As a result In this scenario , Alice pays only 5.5 ETH in total for the protocol's voucher pool fee, instead of the expected 10 ETH.
8. By calling `increaseVouch` with smaller amounts, Alice can reduce her overall voucher pool fee payment.
