# Malicious owner of a compromised address can steal vouched ETH of legitimate Ethos profile owner

### Summary

Missing check for compromised address in the function [unvouch()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L452-L481) inside the EthosVouch contract, will cause a complete loss of vouched ETH for the original profile owner who vouched through their authorAddress, as the attacker now owning the compromised address will unvouch and receive the ETH.

Note that the protocol has implemented an anti-compromise mechanism in the contract EthosProfile where Ethos profile owners can flag if one of their addresses has been compromised. Such compromised addresses are restricted from calling certain functions in the EthosProfile contract through the [onlyNonCompromisedAddress() modifier](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L104-L109), and unlike deleted addresses, [compromised addresses can only be restored by an admin](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L437-L439). This is to show that the anti-compromise mechanism should be considered core functionality.

As per the comment [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L456-L458), funds are attached to addresses and not profiles so a if a profile decided to delete one of their addresses without flagging it as compromised, it is intended design that this address will still be able to unvouch and receive the ETH. But when it is flagged as compromised, it is not intended that the attacker who gained control of the address will also be able to get hold of the vouched ETH.

### Root Cause

In the function unvouch(), there is no check if the authorAddress of the vouch has been compromised.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A legitimate user having an Ethos profile, needs to vouch through one of the profileâ€™s registered addresses.

### External pre-conditions

1. An attacker needs to acquire control of an address that was used to vouch.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls unvouch() and receives the whole amount of ETH of the vouch minus the exit fee.

### Impact

The legitimate (previous) owner of an authorAddress who vouched for a subject profile, will lose all of their vouch (ETH) amount.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue 2 things should be done:

1. First, in the function unvouch() check if the authorAddress is compromised by querying the public mapping [isAddressCompromised](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L72) inside EthosProfile.
2. The protocol needs to redesign the function unvouch() to some degree, to allow another non-compromised address of the profile to unvouch. In that sense, the comment referenced in the summary that speaks about funds being attached to an address rather than a profile needs to be reevaluated.
