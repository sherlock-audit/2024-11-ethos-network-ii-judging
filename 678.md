# insufficient address validation in EthosVouch::vouchByProfileId() Allows Unauthorized Vouch creation

### Summary

A vulnerability in the `vouchByProfileId()` function allows unauthorized vouch creation by compromised or deleted addresses. The issue arises from the lack of address validation in the verifiedProfileIdForAddress() function, which returns a profile ID even if the associated address has been removed

### Root Cause

using the below `VouchByProfileId()` function ,author can vouch(or create a vouch) with a subject id.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L336

```solidity
/**
   * @dev Vouches for profile Id.
   * @param subjectProfileId Subject profile Id.
   * @param comment Comment.
   * @param metadata Metadata.
   */
  function vouchByProfileId(
    uint256 subjectProfileId,
    string calldata comment,
    string calldata metadata
  ) public payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    // validate author profile
    uint256 authorProfileId = IEthosProfile(
      contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
    ).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);//@audit- this allows removed or compromised address to vouch for subject profiles
    
    // pls no vouch for yourself
    if (authorProfileId == subjectProfileId) {
      revert SelfVouch(authorProfileId, subjectProfileId);
    }
.....
```
but in the above code,this is a bug i.e the code does not verify/validate the caller correctly this allow compromised or deleted address of a profileId to create a vouch for the subject which should not be the case(confirmed with sponsor)

now lets understand how the compromised or the deleted address can create vouch 
```solidity
// validate author profile
    uint256 authorProfileId = IEthosProfile(
      contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
    ).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);//@audit- removed or compromised address can vouch for subject profiles
    
```
the above code calls the ethosProfile contract’s verifiedProfileIdForAddress() 

```solidity
function verifiedProfileIdForAddress(address _address) external view returns (uint256) {
    (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock, uint256 profileId) = profileStatusByAddress(_address);
    if (!verified || archived || mock) {
      revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(_address);
    }
    return profileId;
  }

```
now the above function calls the profileStatusByAddress() function internally.

```solidity
/**
   * @dev Returns the status of a profile by its associated address.
   * @notice This does not check if the address has been removed from the profile.
   * It will return the profileId even if the address has been removed.
   * @param addressStr The address to check.
   * @return verified Whether the profile is verified.
   * @return archived Whether the profile is archived.
   * @return mock Whether the profile is a mock profile.
   * @return profileId The ID of the profile associated with the address.
   */
  function profileStatusByAddress(
    address addressStr
  ) public view returns (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock, uint256 profileId) {
    profileId = profileIdByAddress[addressStr];
    (verified, archived, mock) = profileStatusById(profileId);
  }
```
now here is the catch `this function does not check the address has been removed from the profile and it simply returns profileId even if the address has been removed(mentioned in comments)` .and this we can see that this function does not verify the same

this allows the compromised address or deleted address to create a vouch as the function does not validate checks properly


### Internal pre-conditions

no response

### External pre-conditions

no response

### Attack Path

mentioned in the description above

### Impact

Firstly, according to the sponsor(image attached above) and docs,the compromised address should not create the vouch and should not perform certain actions, and secondly, the compromised address can create a vouch using the profileId and vouch for the subject and earn the rewards, and here he/she can also increase the vouches intentionally upto 256 using small deposits.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement the below fix to check if the caller’s address is compromised. If it is, the function reverts.
 
```solidity
 // Check if the address is compromised using EthosProfile
    if (IEthosProfile(contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)).isAddressCompromised(msg.sender)) {
        revert("Address is compromised");
    }

    // Check if the address has been removed
    if (addressIndexByProfileIdAndAddress[authorProfileId][msg.sender] == 0 && profiles[authorProfileId].addresses[0] != msg.sender) {
        revert("Address has been removed");
    }
```
