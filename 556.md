# Misaligned Market Configuration After Removal in removeMarketConfig Leads to Unexpected Market Parameters

### Summary

The `removeMarketConfig` function swaps the last config with the removed config's index, causing subsequent market creations to use unexpected configuration parameters. This leads to markets being created with different parameters than intended by the users.


### Root Cause

When removing a config that isn't the last element, the function performs an index swap without any mechanism to maintain configuration consistency:
[ReputationMarket.sol#L403-L406](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L403-L406)

 ```js
  if (configIndex != lastIndex) {
    marketConfigs[configIndex] = marketConfigs[lastIndex];
}
marketConfigs.pop();
  ```

### Internal pre-conditions

Internal Pre-conditions

1. At least 3 market configurations must exist
2. The configuration being removed must not be the last element in the array
3. Admin calls `removeMarketConfig`
4. User calls createMarketWithConfig(configIndex)
4. The configurations must have different parameters:
```js
Index 0 (Default tier):
- initialLiquidity: 0.002 ETH (2 * DEFAULT_PRICE)
- initialVotes: 1
- basePrice: DEFAULT_PRICE

Index 1 (Deluxe tier):
- initialLiquidity: 0.05 ETH (50 * DEFAULT_PRICE)
- initialVotes: 1000
- basePrice: DEFAULT_PRICE

Index 2 (Premium tier):
- initialLiquidity: 0.1 ETH (100 * DEFAULT_PRICE)
- initialVotes: 10000
- basePrice: DEFAULT_PRICE
```
This is a valid issue here because users expect specific parameters at specific indices when calling `createMarketWithConfig(configIndex)`. After a config removal and swap, the indices no longer match user expectations and markets might be created with unintended parameters.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Initial state: User expect index 1 to be Deluxe tier (0.05 ETH, 1000 votes)
2. Admin removes config at index 1
3. Premium tier (previously at index 2) moves to index 1
4. User calls createMarketWithConfig(1) with 0.05 ETH, expecting Deluxe tier
5. Transaction reverts due to insufficient funds (Premium tier requires 0.1 ETH) OR
6. If user sends 0.1 ETH, they get Premium tier parameters (10000 votes) instead of expected Deluxe tier (1000 votes)


### Impact

Either Market creation transactions revert due to mismatched ETH amounts, OR
Markets created with unexpected initial parameters and Users get different market parameters than intended

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Instead of swapping and popping, use a deletion mechanism that maintains array order or uses a mapping to ensure predictable configuration indices.
