# Users can increase vouch during a paused contract state

### Summary

The [`EthosVouch::increaseVouch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426) function is a core functionality that allows increasing vouch for a particular `vouchId`.
However, this function lacks the `whenNotPaused` modifier, which violates the design of the contract where all other core user facing functions have it.
```solidity
  function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable nonReentrant {   <@ // Lack of `whenNotPaused` modifier
```
Hence, it allows users to increase vouch in a paused contract state, which can lead to loss of funds.

### Root Cause

In [`EthosVouch.sol:426`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426), there is a missing `whenNotPaused` modifier.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to pause the `EthosVouch.sol` contract via `InteractionControl::pauseContract` or `InteractionControl::pauseAll` depending upon criticality of the situation at hand.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. During a paused state, an innocent user calls the [`EthosVouch::increaseVouch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426).

### Impact

1. Pausing contract can be done for various reasons, some of them might be due to an unexpected hack or any critical case, during such a situation, allowing to increase vouch which is a core functionality, that allows users to indirectly deposit native tokens, can lead to loss of funds.

### PoC

The test given below was added in `vouch.increase.test.ts` file.
```typescript
  it ('should be able to increase vouch in a paused state', async () => {
    const { vouchId, balance } = await userA.vouch(userB, { paymentAmount: initialAmount });

    const protocolFeeAmount = calculateFee(increaseAmount, entryFee).fee;
    const donationFeeAmount = calculateFee(increaseAmount, donationFee).fee;
    const expectedDeposit = increaseAmount - protocolFeeAmount - donationFeeAmount;
    // Pausing this particular contract
    await deployer.interactionControl.contract.connect(deployer.OWNER).pauseContract('ETHOS_VOUCH');
    // Checking if the contract is paused
    expect(await deployer.ethosVouch.contract.paused()).to.be.true;
    // Increasing the vouch amount in a paused state
    await deployer.ethosVouch.contract
      .connect(userA.signer)
      .increaseVouch(vouchId, { value: increaseAmount });

    const finalBalance = await userA.getVouchBalance(vouchId);
    // Successfull increase in vouch amount
    expect(finalBalance).to.be.closeTo(balance + expectedDeposit, 1n);

  });
  ```

### Mitigation

It is recommended to add a `whenNotPaused` modifier to the `increaseVouch` function.
```solidity
  function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
```
