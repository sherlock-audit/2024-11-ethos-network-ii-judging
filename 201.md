# Sellers Will Lose Money Due to Incorrect Price Calculation in `ReputationMarket._calculateSell()`

### Summary

The `ReputationMarket._calculateSell()` function applies the smaller price to the seller because it recalculates the `votePrice` after decrementing the votes count in the while-loop. This results in sellers receiving a reduced price for their votes.


### Root Cause

- In the `ReputationMarket._calculateSell()` function, the order of operations inside the while-loop is incorrect:
  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1003-L1045
  ```solidity
      function _calculateSell(
        Market memory market,
        uint256 profileId,
        bool isPositive,
        uint256 amount
      )
        private
        view
        returns (
          uint256 votesSold,
          uint256 fundsReceived,
          uint256 newVotePrice,
          uint256 protocolFee,
          uint256 minVotePrice,
          uint256 maxVotePrice
        )
      {
        uint256 votesAvailable = votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST];

        if (votesAvailable < amount) {
          revert InsufficientVotesOwned(profileId, msg.sender);
        }

  1026: uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);

        uint256 maxPrice = votePrice;
        uint256 minPrice;

        while (votesSold < amount) {
          if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
            revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
          }

  1036:   market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
  1037:   votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
  1038:   fundsReceived += votePrice;
          votesSold++;
        }
        (fundsReceived, protocolFee, ) = previewFees(fundsReceived, false);
        minPrice = votePrice;

        return (votesSold, fundsReceived, votePrice, protocolFee, minPrice, maxPrice);
      }
  ```
  As shown, the function decrement the votes count at `L1036` before calculating the `votePrice` at `L1037` in the while-loop. Therefore, the `votePrice` of the `L1026` is ignored and the smaller price (`L1037`) than the original price (`L1026`) is received by the seller in `L1038`.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. For a market, `votes[TRUST] = 4`, `votes[UNTRUST] = 1` and `basePrice = 0.01 ether`.
2. A seller attempts to sell `1` vote by calling `sellVotes()` function.
3. The original price (`L026`) is `4 * 0.01 ether / 5 = 0.008 ether`.
4. However, the `votePrice` is calculated as `3 * 0.01 ether / 4 = 0.0075 ether` at `L037`.
5. Ignoring fees, the seller receives the lower price `0.0075 ether` instead of correct price `0.008 ether`. 


### Impact

Loss of funds because the sellers receive less than the correct value for their votes.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Reorder the statements in the while-loop to apply the original `votePrice` before decrementing the votes count:
```diff
+     fundsReceived += votePrice;
      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
-     fundsReceived += votePrice;
```
