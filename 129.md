# Incorrect Fee Calculation Results in Vouchers, Vouchees, and the Protocol Receiving Fewer Fees Than Expected, Undermining Incentives for Vouching

## Description

**Context:** Whenever users [vouch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L324-L415) for a profile, the [protocol takes a fee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L941-L943), The vouchee [receives a donation fee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L944-L946), and previous vouchers who have vouched for the same profile [receive a share of the fee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L947-L950). Additionally, when a user [unvouches](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L448-L481) and withdraws their vouched amount, an [exit fee is applied and sent to the protocol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L957-L959).

Currently, the [fee formula](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L967-L989) used in the `EthosVouch` contract to calculate the protocol fee, vouchee donation fee, and previous vouchers fee is as follows:

```javascript
    total - ((total * BASIS_POINT_SCALE) / (BASIS_POINT_SCALE + feeBasisPoints))
```

The use of this formula results in the protocol, the vouchee, and the previous vouchers of a vouchee receiving fewer fees than expected. Here's an example calculation:

Lets say the `total` amount being vouched is `1e18`, and `feeBasisPoints` is `50%`. The correct fee calculation should yield `5e17`. However, using the current formula in the `EthosVouch` contract:

```javascript
    // BASIS_POINT_SCALE = 10000
    // 50% in basis points = 5000
    // Expected output = 5e17
    1e18 - ((1e18 * 10000) / (10000 + 5000)) = 333333333333333333 // 3e17
```

As shown above, the formula results in the protocol, vouchee, and previous vouchers receiving less than the intended fees. This discrepancy can lead to three issues:

1. The Ethos Protocol earns less revenue, impacting its viability as a Web3 business.
2. Users are less incentivized to vouch for others due to reduced rewards.
3. The vouchee (the profile being vouched for) receives fewer donation fees than expected.

## Impact

**Damage:** MED

**Likelihood:** HIGH

**Details:** The use of an incorrect fee formula results in the Ethos Network Protocol earning less revenue, disincentivizes users from vouching for others, and causes vouchees to earn less reward (donation fee) despite being perceived as a profile that users can trust.

## Proof of Concept

**Attack Path:**

1. When a user [vouches](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L324-L415) for a profile, the [protocol, previous vouchers, and vouchee receive fewer fees](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L935-L950) than expected
2. When a user [unvouches](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L448-L481), the [protocol receives less exit fee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L954-L959) than expected

**POC:**

- Not Needed

## Recommended Mitigation

Replace the fee calculation formula with the following:

```javascript
    total * feebasispoint / 10000
```

Using this formula, if we calculate `50% of 1e18`, the result will be:

```javascript
    1e18 * 5000 / 10000 = 500000000000000000 // 5e17
```

This formula produces the correct output and ensures proper fee distribution.
