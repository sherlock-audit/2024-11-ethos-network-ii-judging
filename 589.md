# Upgrades are unsafe

### Summary

Upgrades are not safe

### Root Cause

The inheritance structure of the Ethos contracts presents storage layout challenges. Specifically:

1. Custom contracts `AccessControl` and `SignatureControl` contain unprotected storage variables
2. Missing storage gap implementations in inherited contracts
3. Direct storage variable declarations without upgrade-safe patterns

### Internal pre-conditions

Storage slot collisions become possible during contract upgrades when:

- New storage variables are introduced in `AccessControl`
- Additional state variables are added to `SignatureControl`
- Storage layout modifications occur in inherited contracts

### External pre-conditions

No external conditions required.

### Attack Path

While no direct exploit exists, the storage layout vulnerability creates upgrade risks.

### Impact

Potential outcomes include:

- Storage slot corruption during upgrades
- Data integrity issues in vault contracts
- Unexpected state variable behaviors

### PoC

Storage layout analysis demonstrates the vulnerability.

### Mitigation

Recommended improvements:

1. Implement storage gaps in `AccessControl`
2. Add storage gaps in `SignatureControl`
3. Follow OpenZeppelin's upgradeable contract patterns
4. Consider using `__gap` variables in all inherited contracts
