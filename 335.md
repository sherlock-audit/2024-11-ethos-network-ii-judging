# Buyers always will purchase votes with higher price than expected

### Summary

When users invoke the  `buyVotes`  function in `ReputationMarket.sol` , they allow price fluctuations within a specified range, determined by `slippageBasisPoints`.

Simultaneously, market owners have the ability to purchase votes for their own markets, effectively driving up the prices.
Consequently, buyers end up acquiring votes at inflated prices.


### Root Cause

The primary issues identified are insufficient access control and a lack of preventative measures against front-running attacks.

### Attack Path

1. A user submits a transaction to purchase votes for a market.
2. The market owner calculates the potential increase in value and strategically places a transaction to purchase their own votes before the user's transaction is processed, thereby front-running the buyer driving up the prices.

user's parameters: `profileId`, `isPositive`, `expectedVotes`, `slippageBasisPoints`, `msg.value`

```solidity
minimumVotes = expectedVotes * (SLIPPAGE_POINTS_BASE - slippageBasisPoints) / SLIPPAGE_POINTS_BASE
(fundsAvailable, protocolFee, donation) = previewFees(msg.value, true);
currentTargetVotes =  markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST];
n = markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? DISTRUST : TRUST];          //oppositeVotes

x = currentTargetVotes;
while((x / (x + n) + (x + 1) / (x + n + 1) + ... + (x + minimumVotes - 1) / (x + n + minimumVotes  - 1)) * markets[profileId].basePrice <  fundsAvailable) {
  x++;
}

buyVotes(profileId, isPositive, x - currentTargetVotes, slippageBasisPoints);  // front-running
```
3. This enables the malicious market owner to sell their votes at significantly elevated prices.

### Impact

As a result of this manipulation, buyers consistently find themselves purchasing votes at prices that exceed their expectations.

### Mitigation

- Add access control
```solidity
  if (profileId == _getProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender)) {
    revert("....     ......");
  }
```

- Or add updater to `MarketUpdateInfo` struct and then Check the front-running by market owner
```solidity
  struct MarketUpdateInfo {
    uint256 voteTrust;
    uint256 voteDistrust;
    uint256 positivePrice;
    uint256 negativePrice;
    uint256 lastUpdateBlock;
    uint256 updaterProfileId;     // added
  }
```
Add checking code to `ReputationMarket.sol:448`.
`if (lastMarketUpdates[profileId].updaterProfileId == profileId) { revert MarliciousMarketOwner(profileId); }`
