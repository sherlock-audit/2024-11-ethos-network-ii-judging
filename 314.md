# Users could overpay fees when buying votes

### Summary

The `previewFees` function in `_calculateBuy` is applied to the total `funds` being transferred by the user. This leads to users paying for more funds that they are actually transacting.

### Root Cause

In [`ReputationMarket:960`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L960), users will specify an amount of `funds` that they are willing to pay in exchange for votes. However, the specified `funds` might not be fully used in order to buy the votes, given the following logic in `_calculateBuy`:

```solidity
// ReputationMarket.sol

function _calculateBuy(
    Market memory market,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 funds
  )
    private
    view
    returns (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      uint256 newVotePrice,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    )
  {
    uint256 fundsAvailable;
    (fundsAvailable, protocolFee, donation) = previewFees(funds, true); 
    uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);

    uint256 minPrice = votePrice;
    uint256 maxPrice;

    if (fundsAvailable < votePrice) {
      revert InsufficientFunds();
    }

    while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
      fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
      fundsPaid += votePrice;
      votesBought++;

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    }
    fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;

    maxPrice = votePrice;

    return (votesBought, fundsPaid, votePrice, protocolFee, donation, minPrice, maxPrice);
  }

```

As shown in the snippet, the amount of votes bought is determined by a loop that will run while the `fundsAvailable` are greater than the `votePrice`. As the price of votes increases due to the buy pressure, the loop will be finished, having `fundsAvailable` (which consists of the user's submitted `funds` with the fees substracted) be nearly always greater than the actual `fundsPaid` (which consists of the price paid for each vote + fees + donation fee).

The problem with this approach is that fees are being applied to an amount that, as demonstrated, is not necessarily the total amount used to actually buy the votes.

### Attack Path

Let's say a user 1 wants to buy 2 `TRUST` votes for a recently created market, where `basePrice` is 0,01 ETH and theres 1 `TRUST` and 1 `DISTRUST` vote already in the market.

1. The price of one vote is given by `market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] * market.basePrice) / totalVotes`, so the price is 0,005 ETH (1 * 0,01 / 2) for the first vote, and ≈ 0,0066  (2 * 0,01 / 3) for the second vote, which adds up to a total of 0,0116 ETH. A 10 % fee is applied (so fee is 0,00116), so the total that user should deposit is 0,01276.

2. At the same time, and prior to user 1 buying the votes, user 2 submits a buy transaction for one `TRUST` vote. This leaves the state of the vote prices to a different price than the expected by user 1. Still, user 1 submits the transaction with a value of 0,01276.
3. Because user 2 has triggered the buy operation prior to user 1, the initial vote price for user 1 is 0,0066 ETH (2 * 0,01 / 3). As user 1 submitted 0,01276 as `funds`, and without the 10% in fees, the `fundsAvailable` for user 1 are 0,011484. Note that 0,001276 are paid in fees.
4. While in the loop:
- First iteration: `votePrice` starts at 0,0066, and `fundsAvailable` are 0,011484, so one vote is purchased. The `fundsPaid` increases to 0,0066.
- Second iteration: `votePrice` now is at 0,0075 (3 * 0,01 / 4).  `fundsAvailable` are 0,004884, so it is not enough to buy a second vote
5. The result is that user 1 has only been able to purchase a single vote. The actual transacted value has only been 0,0066 (the price of one vote), for which a 10% fee would have implied 0,00066 ETH (≈ 2,442 USD). However, as shown in step 1, user 1 has paid 0,00116 ETH (≈  4,292 USD, **nearly the double!**).

On the long run, situations like this will arise, leading to a perpetual loss of funds for protocol users due to the increase 

### Impact

Medium. As shown in the "Attack Path" section, fees will be overcharged for users that buy votes. On the long term, it is easy that the total value loss exceeds 10 USD or 10% of user value, (considering that new markets might also be configured, with base prices of 0,1 or even 1 ETH).


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When triggering `buyVotes`, allow users to specify the amount of votes they want, instead of the amount of ETH to pay (similar to the logic used when selling). Then, apply the corresponding fees considering the actual amount that user will pay.
