# Slashing only punish vouchers and not creators

### Summary

`EthosVouch` has a way to punish misdeeds (trying to manipulate the system, spamming fake accounts and so on...) using `slash`, where any user can be slashed for up to 10% of his balance across all vouches.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L531-L545
```solidity
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchIds.length; i++) {
      Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];

      if (!vouch.archived) {
        uint256 slashAmount = vouch.balance.mulDiv(
          slashBasisPoints,
          BASIS_POINT_SCALE,
          Math.Rounding.Floor
        );
        if (slashAmount > 0) {
          vouch.balance -= slashAmount;
          totalSlashed += slashAmount;
        }
      }
    }
```
However this mechanism is intrinsically incomplete as the only one who is punishable is the user who is vouching.

Users who are vouched for, consistently have higher impact on the space than the mere vouchers. Example would be a tweet from a person who has 1m followers and someone who is following that guy with only 500 followers. Clearly the one who everyone vouches for would have the higher impact.

With higher impact it becomes easy to misbehave massively, as all of your auctions are magnified, making malicious acts more easy and more damaging. That combined with the fact that no one can punish you **makes misbehaving, not only easy, but free**.

### Root Cause

`slash` only effecting vouchers and not the users who they are vouching

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Creator misbehaves massively, at a point where if he was a voucher he would have been slashed
2. Creator is not a voucher, at least not from this account, so `slash` cannot punish him

### Impact

Creators will not be punishable, unlike their vouchers.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In order to create a voting market inside `ReputationMarket` you need to deposit a minimum amount of ETH. Consider implementing the same inside `EthosVouch`. This would allow slashing creators who misbehaved by taking this amount out.
