# `buyVotes` makes `ReputationMarket` insolvent

### Summary

Users use `buyVotes` to vote for another user and for such they pay for every vote in ETH.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442
```solidity
  function buyVotes(...) public payable whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // Determine how many votes can be bought with the funds provided
    (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);
```

The price, votes and the amount this user would pay is calculated inside `_calculateBuy`, where we would take note that returned `fundsPaid` is all of the ETH used to buy votes + both `protocolFee` and `donation` fees

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L978
```solidity
    fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;

    maxPrice = votePrice;

    return (votesBought, fundsPaid, votePrice, protocolFee, donation, minPrice, maxPrice);
  }
```

Later when we get back into `buyVotes` we can see that an issue appears. We send the appropriate fees using `applyFees(protocolFee, donation, profileId);`, however at the end of the function we also increase `marketFunds[profileId]` by `fundsPaid`. From `_calculateBuy` we have seen that `fundsPaid` already accounts `protocolFee` and `donation`, but these are already sent, meaning they they are accounted twice! Once send in `applyFees` and then added to `marketFunds`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481
```solidity
    _checkSlippageLimit(votesBought, expectedVotes, slippageBasisPoints);

    // Send fees
    applyFees(protocolFee, donation, profileId);

    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += votesBought;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += votesBought;

    if (!isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender]) {
      participants[profileId].push(msg.sender);
      isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = true;
    }

    uint256 refund = msg.value - fundsPaid;
    if (refund > 0) _sendEth(refund);
    
    // Buy increase `marketFunds` by `fundsPaid +  protocolFee + donation` fees ?
    marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
```


### Root Cause

`marketFunds` being increased by `protocolFee` and `donation`, instead of only the real votes value.

```solidity
marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Insolvency since the contract holds all ETH balances, meaning if we send the fees and later `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` is called, we would have taken more ETH out than we attributed inside the internal accounting. This ETH will come from other profile votes, eventually leading to insolvency.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Consider these 2 changes 

Inside [_calculateBuy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L942-L983):
```diff
    while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
      fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
      fundsPaid += votePrice;
      votesBought++;

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    }
    // In order for `fundsPaid` to be only the value paid for buying votes
-   fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;

    maxPrice = votePrice;
```


Inside [buyVotes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L471-L493):
```diff
-   uint256 refund = msg.value - fundsPaid;
+   uint256 refund = msg.value - (fundsPaid +donation + protocolFee) ;
    if (refund > 0) _sendEth(refund);

    emit VotesBought(
      profileId,
      msg.sender,
      isPositive,
      votesBought,
-     fundsPaid
+     fundsPaid + donation + protocolFee, // So the event is emitted by the old standard (all funds used)
      block.timestamp,
      minVotePrice,
      maxVotePrice
    );
```
This way the amounts will be calculated correctly, while at the same time the user will be refunded what he is supposed to.
