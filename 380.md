# Address reassignment can permanently lock user rewards

### Summary

The system for managing rewards linked to mock profiles has a critical flaw. When an address or attestation data associated with a mock profile is reassigned to another profile, the rewards linked to the original mock profile ID become permanently inaccessible. This design oversight can lead to a loss of funds.

### Root Cause

Rewards are tied solely to the `recipientProfileId` (mock profile ID) during `_depositRewards`. If the mock profile is later disassociated due to address or attestation data reassignment, the rewards remain locked to the mock profile ID, which can no longer be accessed.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Rewards for vouching are deposited using `_depositRewards` and are linked exclusively to the mock profile ID.  
2. Mock profiles are created during interactions such as reviews tied to unverified addresses or attestations.  

```solidity
File: ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol
  687:   function _depositRewards(uint256 amount, uint256 recipientProfileId) internal {
  688:     rewards[recipientProfileId] += amount;//audit: 
  689:     emit DepositedToRewards(recipientProfileId, amount);
  690:   }
```

### External pre-conditions

1. A mock profile is created, either by submitting a review for an unverified address or for attestation data.  
2. Vouching activity generates rewards, which are tied to the mock profile ID using `_depositRewards`.  
3. The address or attestation data is later reassigned to a verified full profile, detaching it from the mock profile.  

### Attack Path

1. A mock profile is created via a review or attestation.  
2. Users vouch for the mock profile, triggering `_depositRewards` to allocate rewards to the mock profile ID.  
3. The address or attestation is reassigned to existing full profile.  
4. The mock profile ID remains associated with the rewards, but msg.sender—the address previously linked to the mock profile—is now associated with a different profile. This causes the profile validation in claimRewards to fail, as the callerProfileId derived from msg.sender no longer matches the mock profile ID.

```solidity
File: ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol
  667:   function claimRewards() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
  668:     (bool verified, , bool mock, uint256 callerProfileId) = IEthosProfile(
  669:       contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
  670:     ).profileStatusByAddress(msg.sender);
  671: 
  672:     // Only check that this is a real profile (not mock) and was verified at some point
  673:     if (!verified || mock) {
  674:       revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(msg.sender);
  675:     }
  676: 
  677:     uint256 amount = rewards[callerProfileId];
  678:     if (amount == 0) revert InsufficientRewardsBalance();
  679: 
  680:     rewards[callerProfileId] = 0;
  681:     (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: amount }("");
  682:     if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Rewards claim failed");
  683: 
  684:     emit WithdrawnFromRewards(callerProfileId, amount);
  685:   }
```

5. Rewards remain tied to the mock profile ID and become unclaimable.

### Impact

1. **Permanent Reward Loss:** Rewards tied to mock profiles are no longer accessible after reassignment.  
2. **Disrupted User Experience:** Users are unable to claim rightful rewards.  

### PoC

1. Create a mock profile via a review tied to an unverified address or attestation.  
2. Vouch for the mock profile, depositing rewards through `_depositRewards`.  
3. Reassign the address or attestation data to a new full profile.  
4. Attempt to claim rewards for the mock profile and observe the failure due to ID mismatch.  

### Mitigation

**Resolution Depends on Project Business Assumptions**  
The approach to resolving this issue depends on the intended behavior and assumptions of the project. Below are potential solutions:  

1. **Dual Reward Tracking:** Modify `_depositRewards` to track rewards by both the profile ID and the address/attestation hash.
2. **Claim Enhancements:** Update `claimRewards` to check for rewards by profile ID, associated address, and attestation hash.
3. **Reversion Mechanism:** Introduce a mechanism to revert addresses or attestations back to mock profiles if rewards remain unclaimed.
