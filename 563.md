# Mock profiles can't create markets in `ReputationMarket` even though they can be vouched for.

### Summary

Mock profiles can be vouched for. It means that these profiles can actively participate in the protocol and earn donation fees inside the system. For most of the profiles the next step is market creation inside the `ReputationMarket` contract. However mock profiles can't create markets what prevents them from earning rewards in that contract.

### Root Cause

`_getProfileIdForAddress` will revert if the profile is mock. In EthosVouch this profile can be vouched for.
