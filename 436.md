# The `EthosVouch.claimRewards()` function should only be callable by a specific address, rather than by holders of the same `profileId`.

### Summary

The protocol aims to associate `ownership of funds` with an address rather than a profile. This approach helps prevent funds from being drained if one of several addresses is compromised.

However, the current design allows holders of the same `profileId` to claim rewards. This mechanism poses a potential risk of fund loss.

### Root Cause

As shown in the [claimRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L668) function, holders of the same `profileId` can claim rewards.

```solidity
       function claimRewards() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
668:     (bool verified, , bool mock, uint256 callerProfileId) = IEthosProfile(
           contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
         ).profileStatusByAddress(msg.sender);
     
         // Only check that this is a real profile (not mock) and was verified at some point
         if (!verified || mock) {
           revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(msg.sender);
         }
     
677:     uint256 amount = rewards[callerProfileId];
         if (amount == 0) revert InsufficientRewardsBalance();
     
         rewards[callerProfileId] = 0;
681:     (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: amount }("");
         if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Rewards claim failed");
     
         emit WithdrawnFromRewards(callerProfileId, amount);
       }
```
