# Selling a vote could result in an incorrect marketFund by generating a negative value.

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L522

`marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;`

This code will revert with an arithmetic error if marketFunds is calculated as a negative value. As a result, the marketFunds[profileId] value will remain unchanged. Consequently, when withdrawing marketFunds, the contract may incur a loss.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495

In sellVotes function, when calculate marketFunds after sell vote, it might generate negative value.
```Solidity
marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
emit VotesSold(
      profileId,
      msg.sender,
      isPositive,
      votesSold,
      fundsReceived,
      block.timestamp,
      minVotePrice,
      maxVotePrice
    );
_emitMarketUpdate(profileId);
```

If marketFunds[profileId] is less than fundsReceived, the code will cause an arithmetic error and revert. 
As a result, marketFunds will not be updated, and the _emitMarketUpdate function will not be called. 
Since marketFunds isn't subtracted, the contract will lose some ETH when withdrawing marketFunds. 
Additionally, since the VotesSold event and the _emitMarketUpdate function are not called, the market values will not be reported correctly.

### Attack Path

- How can marketFunds be decreased?
Let's assume to create market with following config

DEFAULT_PRICE = 0.01 ether;
initialLiquidity: 2 * DEFAULT_PRICE,
initialVotes: 1,
basePrice: DEFAULT_PRICE
entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints fee : 200 // 2%
donationBasisPoints fee  : 100 // 1%
exitProtocolFeeBasisPoints  : 200 // 2%

So Market information is following.
Trust Vote : 1
Distrust Vote : 1
MarketFunds : 0.002 ether;

1. buy 1 distrust vote  with 0.006 eth.
  
   protocolFee = 0.006 * 2 / 100 = 0.00012
   donation  =  0.006 * 1 / 100 = 0.00006

   current votes : trust : 1, distrust : 1   
   votePrice = 0.01 * 1 / (1+1) = 0.005
   
   fundsPaid = 0.005 +  0.00012 +  0.00006 = 0.00518

   so marketFunds += 0.00518;

2. buy 2 trust votes with 0.01 eth.

   protocolFee =  0.01 * 2 / 100 = 0.0002
   donation  =   0.01 * 1 / 100 = 0.0001

   current votes : trust : 1, distrust : 2   
   first vote : votePrice = 0.01 * 1 / (1 +2) = 0.0033333
   current votes : trust : 2, distrust : 2   
   2nd vote : votePrice = 0.01 * 2 / (2+2) = 0.005

   fundsPaid = 0.0033333 + 0.005 + 0.0002 + 0.0001 = 0.0086333

   so marketFunds +=0.0086333;

3. After buying,  Total marketFunds +=  0.0138133 ( = 0.00518 + 0.0086333)

4. Sell 1 distrust vote
   
    current votes : trust : 3, distrust : 2   
    votePrice = 0.01 * ( 2 - 1 )/ (3 + (2 - 1)) = 0.0025
    
    fundsReceived = 0.0025;
    protocolFee =  fundsReceived  * 2 / 100 = 0.00005

    fundsReceived = 0.0025 - 0.00005 = 0.00245

    so marketFunds -= 0.00245

5. Sell 2 trust votes
 
    current votes : trust : 3, distrust : 1   
    votePrice = 0.01 * (3 - 1) / ( (3-1) + 1) = 0.006666
    fundsReceived = 0.0066666;
    current votes : trust : 2, distrust : 1   
    votePrice = 0.01 * (2 - 1) / ( (2-1) + 1) = 0.005
    fundsReceived = 0.0066666 + 0.005 = 0.0116666;

    protocolFee =  fundsReceived  * 2 / 100 = 0.000233332

    fundsReceived = 0.0116666 - 0.000233332 = 0.011433268

    so marketFunds -= 0.011433268

    
6. After selling,  Total marketFunds -=  0.013883268 ( = 0.00245 + 0.011433268)

As a result, after buying and selling

marketFunds += ( 0.0138133 - 0.013883268)
marketFunds += ( - 0.000069968)

### Impact

Voter will earn 0.000069968 eth per every cycle of steps 1 to 6 of the external pre-condition.

And if steps 1 to 6 of the external pre-condition are repeated multiple times, marketFunds will gradually decrease.

In the final call to the sellVotes function, before marketFunds is calculated as a negative value, the code marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived will revert, and marketFunds will remain unchanged.

When withdrawing marketFunds, the contract will pay more, equivalent to the latest fundsReceived that is not reflected on marketFunds.

And the VotesSold event and the _emitMarketUpdate function in latest sellVotes function are not called, the market values will not be reported correctly.
