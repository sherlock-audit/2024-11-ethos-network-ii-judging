# First voucher does not pay any fee

### Summary

When vouching for a user, the voucher must pay a `vouchersPoolFee`, which can be up to 10% of his vouched amount. That fee is divided between the rest of the vouchers as a reward.

However the first user who vouches, does not pay the fee. That is because `_rewardPreviousVouchers` would return 0 in such a case, not charging the user anything.

```solidity
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalVouches; i++) {
      Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];
      if (!vouch.archived) {
        totalBalance += vouch.balance;
      }
    }

    if (totalBalance == 0) {
      return totalBalance;
    }
```

### Root Cause

`_rewardPreviousVouchers` returning 0, allowing the first voucher to vouch without paying a `vouchersPoolFee`

```solidity
    if (totalBalance == 0) {
      return totalBalance;
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

`protocolFee` is 1% and `donationFee` is 9%
1. Max total voucher per person are set to 5, as only whales will vouch
2. 5 users vouch, each vouching 100 ETH
3. The first user would pay 1 ETH as protocol fee, but the rest would pay 10 ETH

The first user, either by accident or intent paid a fee which is 10 times less than the rest of the voucher

### Impact

First user avoids paying a fee

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Send it as a donation to the one we are vouching for, in order to make the game fair for later participants too and incentive the user who people vouch for at all stages of the game.
