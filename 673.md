# Protocol will get less fee than the set fee-basis-points in EthosVouch.sol

### Summary

The function calFee() used to calculate and get fees taken by the protocol. It's used in the applyFee() which is called when a user vouch, increase vouch and unvouch. The protocol takes a different approach when calculating fees which results in less fee than the usual calculation.

### Root Cause

The [calFee()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L975) calculates in the following way:

```solidity
  function calcFee(uint256 total, uint256 feeBasisPoints) internal pure returns (uint256 fee) {
    return
      total -
      (total.mulDiv(BASIS_POINT_SCALE, (BASIS_POINT_SCALE + feeBasisPoints), Math.Rounding.Floor));
  }
```
This calculation cannot support high fees and is not accurate except for small fees.

To prove my point, although this is hypothetical, assume feeBasisPoints is 10000(i.e 100%). The function will return half of the total instead of the total.

If `feeBasisPoints` is 5000(i.e 50%), the function will return 1 / 3 of the total as fees.

If `feeBasisPoints` is 2500(i.e 25%), the function will return 1/5 of the total as fees.

This is not possible in reality as the protocol will not take such high amount of fees. However even with reasonable `feeBasisPoints`, the protocol still takes less fees than it intends to.

Lets say the fee is 2.5%(250 basis points) across all fees. Which adds up to 10% total.

For each calculation of fee, the protocol will take ~2.43% instead of 2.5% as shown in the POC below.

Since the [applyFee()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L929) calculates fees `4` time throughout the lifetime of a vouch, the protocol will take ~0.28% less fee.

Considering, the fees are also rounded down during calculations, the discrepancy can get bigger in ETH or $ terms.

### Internal pre-conditions

Admin needs to set non 0 fees.

### External pre-conditions

Users vouch, increase vouch or unvouch.

### Attack Path

### Impact

The protocol gets less fees than it intends to take. For 1% fees, the protocol will get ~9.9%. For 10% fees the protocol will get ~9.09%. 
The more fees it takes, the less fees it gets.

### PoC

I created a new contract with just the `calFee()` function and made a Test file for it.

```solidity
pragma solidity 0.8.26;
import {Math} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/Math.sol";

contract Cal {
    using Math for uint256;

    uint256 public constant BASIS_POINT_SCALE = 10000;
    uint256[] public votes;

    function calcFee(
        uint256 total,
        uint256 feeBasisPoints
    ) public pure returns (uint256 fee) {
        return
            total - (total.mulDiv(BASIS_POINT_SCALE, (BASIS_POINT_SCALE + feeBasisPoints), Math.Rounding.Floor));
    }
}
```


```solidity

pragma solidity 0.8.26;

import {Test, console} from "forge-std/Test.sol";
import {Cal} from "../src/EthosVouch.sol";
import {Math} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/Math.sol";

contract EthosVouchMathTest is Test {
    Cal public feeCal;
    using Math for uint256;

    function setUp() public {
        feeCal = new Cal();
    }

    function test_cal(uint256 amount, uint256 feeBasisPoints) public {
        amount = 1 ether;
        feeBasisPoints = 250;
        uint256 fee = feeCal.calcFee(amount, feeBasisPoints);
        uint256 deposit = amount - fee;
        uint256 actualFeeBP = fee.mulDiv(10000, amount, Math.Rounding.Floor);

        console.log("Fee", fee);
        console.log("Deposit", deposit);
        console.log("percentage", actualFeeBP);
    }
}
```

This is the log: 

``` block
  [11667] EthosVouchMathTest::test_cal(3, 1)
