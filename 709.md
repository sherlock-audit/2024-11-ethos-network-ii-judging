# Admins can set total fees to exceed 10% of `BASIS_POINT_SCALE`

### Summary

An incorrect value for `MAX_TOTAL_FEES`, allows cumulative fees to exceed the intended 10% of the `BASIS_POINT_SCALE`. This issue arises because `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is set to `10000`, representing 100% instead of 10%. Admins can unintentionally (or maliciously) configure fee percentages that result in excessive fees being charged to users.

From doc:
> Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%


### Root Cause

In `EthosVouch.sol`, the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` constant is set to `10000` (see [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120)) instead of `1000`, which represents 10% of the `BASIS_POINT_SCALE`. This discrepancy allows cumulative fees (entry protocol fee, exit fee, donation fee, and vouchers pool fee) to reach 100% rather than the intended 10%.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admins set the following fee values (as an example, admin can set one fee to 100%):
  - Entry protocol fee: `5000` basis points (50%).
  - Donation fee: `2500` basis points (25%).
  - Vouchers pool fee: `2500` basis points (25%).
2. The contract incorrectly calculates total fees using the oversized `MAX_TOTAL_FEES`.

### External pre-conditions

None. This issue arises solely from internal misconfiguration.

### Attack Path

  1. Admins call `setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints(5000)`.
  2. Admins call `setEntryDonationFeeBasisPoints(2500)`.
  3. Admins call `setEntryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints(2500)`.
  4. A user interacts with the contract, incurring a total fee of 100% instead of 10%.

### Impact

Users are charged excessive fees due to the miscalculated fee limit, resulting in financial loss. The discrepancy could also undermine trust in the protocol and harm its reputation.

### PoC

Hereâ€™s a test case that demonstrates the issue (use it as part of `ethos/packages/contracts/test/vouch/vouch.fees.test.ts` file):

```ts
  it('Maximum total fees exceed 10%', async () => {
    const entryFee = 5000n;
    const donationFee = 2500n;
    const vouchIncentives = 2500n;
  
    await deployer.ethosVouch.contract
      .connect(deployer.ADMIN)
      .setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints(entryFee);
  
    await deployer.ethosVouch.contract
      .connect(deployer.ADMIN)
      .setEntryDonationFeeBasisPoints(donationFee);
  
    await deployer.ethosVouch.contract
      .connect(deployer.ADMIN)
      .setEntryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints(vouchIncentives);
  
    const amount = 100000000000000000n; // 0.1 ETH
    const { vouchId } = await userA.vouch(userB, { paymentAmount: amount });
    const balance = await userA.getVouchBalance(vouchId);
  
    const feeTaken = amount - balance;
    const feeAt10Percent = (amount * 1000n) / 10000n;
  
    expect(feeTaken).to.be.gt(feeAt10Percent);
  });
```

### Mitigation

Change the value of MAX_TOTAL_FEES to 1000 to reflect 10% of the BASIS_POINT_SCALE.
```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000; // Represents 10%
uint256 public constant BASIS_POINT_SCALE = 10000; // Basis point scale
```
