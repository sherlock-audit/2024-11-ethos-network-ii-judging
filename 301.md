# Funds Tracking Vulnerability in Market Funds Calculation

### Summary

An accounting logic error will cause incorrect market funds tracking for users as the current implementation improperly includes protocol fees and donations in market funds calculation 

### Root Cause

in `ReputationMarket.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481 the market fund tracking mechanism incorrectly includes protcol fees and donation amounts when updating `marketFunds[profileId]`,  as it should account for funds directly related to the market rather than adding protocol fees and donation which are sent somewhere else 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User needs to call buyVote() function
2. includes protocol fees and donation amounts
3. marketFunds[profileId] exists for the specific profile

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls `buyVote()` function to purchase votes
2. Function calculates `fundsPaid` including protocol fees and donations
3. `marketFunds[profileId]` gets updated with total `fundsPaid`
4. Protocol fees are sent to `protocolFeeAddress`
5. Donations are sent to `donationEscrow`
6. `marketFunds[profileId]` remains incorrectly inflated

### Impact

The users and protocol suffer from incorrect market funds tracking. Specifically:

1. Market funds are overestimated by including fees redirected to other addresses
2. Potential miscalculations during market graduation or fund withdrawal processes
3. Accounting inconsistencies that could lead to future systemic issues

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the market funds update to exclude protocol fees and donations:

```solidity 
// Before (Vulnerable)
marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;

// After (Corrected)
marketFunds[profileId] += (fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation);
```
