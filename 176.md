# Lack of slippage protection in sellVotes

### Summary

Lack of slippage protection in `sellVotes` could lead to loss of user funds. 

### Root Cause

In function `sellVotes`

```solidity
    (
      uint256 votesSold,
      uint256 fundsReceived,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);
```
It calls `_calculateSell` to calc `fundsReceived` which is the amout that user received. 
However, the vote price is volatile, and if someone sells votes, the amount the user receives will be significantly lower.
For example:
1. Alice and Bob both have 100 trust votes in the same market.
2. Alice wants to sell 100 trust votes and calls simulateSell to estimate the amount she would receive.
3. Bob sells his trust votes before Alice, causing the vote price to drop.
4. Alice then calls sellVotes and ends up losing funds.
