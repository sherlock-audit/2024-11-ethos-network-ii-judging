# Maximum total fees can exceed 10%

### Summary

The fees calculated is in form of percentage in basis points. in this percentage, the max value is 10,000 which stands for 100%.
The expected total value for the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` should be 1,000 however its hardcoded to 10,000 which means the 10% check will not be done for setting the fee values.

### Root Cause

The root cause is the mistake of setting max value to 10,000 instead of 1000.
