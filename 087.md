# Users can vouch for a short period of time to grief other users and steal the `vouchersPoolFee` of every call to add or increase a vouch during that period

### Summary

A missing check to reward only vouches that have been active for a specific amount of time will cause users to lose their rightful share of the `vouchersPoolFee`, as any user can vouch for only a short period of time as soon as they get information about when a vouch is going to be added. Therefore, users can steal the `vouchersPoolFee` applied to any call to `EthosVouch::vouchByAddress()`, `EthosVouch::vouchByProfileId()` or `EthosVouch::increaseVouch()`.

### Root Cause

In `EthosVouch.sol:721` [every](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L721-L730) vouch that is currently active for the same subject, regardless of how long it has been active, receives a share of the `vouchersPoolFee`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints` must be greater than `0`.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Alice receives information about when Bob wants to vouch.
2. Alice calls `EthosVouch::vouchByAddress()` to vouch for that address.
3. Bob calls `EthosVouch::vouchByAddress()` to add his vouch.
4. Alice steals a share of the `vouchersPoolFee` from other users even though she has only vouched for a brief period of time.
5. Alice calls `EthosVouch::unvouch()` to remove her vouch.

### Impact

Users who vouched for the same subject could lose a significant portion of their deserved share of the `vouchersPoolFee` every time the reward is distributed. Even though this might not be profitable for the users stealing the funds, they will still cause other non-malicious users to lose funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding a threshold for how long a user must be vouched for in order to receive a share of the `vouchersPoolFee`.
