# First Voucher Cannot Revouch for the Same Subject After Unvouching

### Summary

The `vouchId` counter starts from zero, which creates a logic issue. When the first voucher unvouches, the `vouchId` is not effectively deleted due to its initial value of zero. This prevents the first voucher from revouching for the same subject.


### Root Cause

- The `vouchId` starts from zero in the [EthosVouch.vouchByProfileId()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L387) function.
```solidity
  function vouchByProfileId(
    uint256 subjectProfileId,
    string calldata comment,
    string calldata metadata
  ) public payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    ------ SKIP ------
    uint256 count = vouchCount;
    ------ SKIP ------
    vouchIdByAuthorForSubjectProfileId[authorProfileId][subjectProfileId] = count;
    ------ SKIP ------
    vouchCount++;
  }
```
- During unvouching, the [EthosVouch._removeVouchFromArrays()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L1038) function attempts to delete the entry:
```solidity
    delete vouchIdByAuthorForSubjectProfileId[v.authorProfileId][v.subjectProfileId];
```
However, since the vouchId is already 0, this deletion has no effect.
- When the same author tries to revouch, the [EthosVouch._vouchShouldNotExistFor](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L844-L848) reverts because the `vouchIdByAuthorForSubjectProfileId[author][subjectProfileId].activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt > 0`.
```solidity
  function _vouchShouldNotExistFor(uint256 author, uint256 subjectProfileId) private view {
    if (vouchExistsFor(author, subjectProfileId)) {
      revert AlreadyVouched(author, subjectProfileId);
    }
  }
```


### Internal pre-conditions

- The author profile creates the first-ever vouch in the protocol.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A voucher creates a vouch for the first time in the contract. Therefore, `vouchId == 0`.
2. The voucher unvouches. The `vouchId` is not effectively deleted because it is zero.
3. When the voucher attempts to revouch for the same subject, the the `_vouchShouldNotExistFor()` function reverts.


### Impact

The first voucher in the protocol is permanently unable to revouch for the same subject after unvouching.

### Mitigation

Modify the `vouchCount` initialization to start from one instead of zero.
