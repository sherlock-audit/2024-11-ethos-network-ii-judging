# Missing slippage checks allows users to receive less funds than expected when selling votes

### Summary

Because there is no check for slippage when triggering `ReputationMarket`'s `sellVotes`, users can end up selling their votes at a smaller price than expected, incurring an undesired loss.

### Root Cause

In [`ReputationMarket.sol::501`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495), the `sellVotes` function does not allow users to set slippage as the `buyVotes` function does.  Because of this, users could sell their votes at an undesired rate, incurring an unexpected loss of funds.

Note that the issue does not only arise in frontrunning scenarios. As demonstrated in the "Attack path" section, multiple users interacting with the protocol at the same time could also cause the issue.

### Internal pre-conditions

- User 1 wants to sell some votes at the current rate
- User 2 also wants to sell some votes at the current rate

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User 1 wants to sell 10 `TRUST` votes for a market with the default `basePrice` of 0,01 ETH. There are 50 `TRUST` votes and 50 `DISTRUST` votes. The expected initial price per vote to obtain for User 1 is then 0,005 ETH (50 * 0,01 / 100), which at the time of writing with timestamp 1733297946 has an equivalent USD price of 18,5 USD. 
2. User 2 is also interacting with the protocol. Prior to the first user's vote selling, user 2 sells 30 `TRUST` votes. Due to the logic in the contract (mimicking supply and demand), vote price of `TRUST` decreases. After user 2 selling 30 votes, the price per vote becomes ≈ 0,0028 ETH (20 * 0,01 / 70), which is equivalent to ≈ 10,36 USD.
3. Finally, user 1 actually sells their 10 `TRUST` votes. As demonstrated, the price per vote has decreased in ≈ 8 USD per vote, which leads to a loss of more than 10 USD value.

This is just an example of attack path. Other scenarios could lead to a bigger or smaller loss for users, depending on the amounts to be sold and the current state of the Reputation Market.


### Impact

High. Following [Sherlock's guidelines on how to identify a high issue](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/audits/judging/guidelines#iv.-how-to-identify-a-high-issue), and as demonstrated in the attack path, depending on the amount being sold and in the market configuration, users will incur a loss of more than 10$ and more than 1% of their principal, which must be considered as a high issue.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Just like `buyVotes` allows users to specify `expectedVotes`, allow users to specify an `expectedValue` when selling votes, allowing potential slippage to be handled by the code.
