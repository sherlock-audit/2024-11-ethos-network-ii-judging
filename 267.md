# Default Market configuration is incorrectly set, leading to massive overpayment by users when creating market with that config

### Summary

Default Market configuration is incorrectly set, leading to massive overpayment by users when creating market with that config

### Root Cause

In `ReputationMarket.sol`, the initialize function, sets up the initial market configuration. The initial market configs are pushed to `marketConfigs[]`, where the initial liquidity is set, but the `initialLiquidity` set, is incorrect, as it differs from the expected initial liquidity which ultimately results in `initialLiquidty` to be set `10x` more than required.

Take a look at the following lines of code

- [ReputationMarket.sol#L79](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L79)

```solidity 
uint256 public constant DEFAULT_PRICE = 0.01 ether; //@audit - default price used to calculate initial liquidity later
```


- [ReputationMarket.sol#L219-L229](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L219-L229)

```solidity

    // Default tier
    // - Minimum viable liquidity for small/new markets
@>>>// - 0.002 ETH initial liquidity @audit requires 0.002 ether as initial liquidity
    // - 1 vote each for trust/distrust (volatile price at low volume)
    marketConfigs.push(
      MarketConfig({
@>>>    initialLiquidity: 2 * DEFAULT_PRICE, //@audit - default price is 0.01 ether, so initial liquidity is 0.01 * 2 = 0.02 ether instead of 0.002 ether as mentioned in docs above
        initialVotes: 1,
        basePrice: DEFAULT_PRICE
      })
    );
```

We observe a similar scenario for the other two tiers, where the `initialLiquidity` is set to `0.5 ether instead of 0.05 ether`, and `1 ether instead of 0.1 ether`, respectively for the `Deluxe` & `Premium` Tiers.


- [ReputationMarket.sol#L231-L241](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L231-L241)

```solidity
    // Deluxe tier
    // - Moderate liquidity for established profiles
@>>>// - 0.05 ETH initial liquidity @audit requires 0.05 ether as initial liquidity
    // - 1,000 votes each for trust/distrust (moderate price stability)
    marketConfigs.push(
      MarketConfig({
@>>>    initialLiquidity: 50 * DEFAULT_PRICE, //@audit - default price is 0.01 ether, i.e initial liquidity is 0.01 * 50 = 0.5 ether instead of 0.05 ether as mentioned in docs above
        initialVotes: 1000,
        basePrice: DEFAULT_PRICE
      }) 
    );
```

- [ReputationMarket.sol#L243-L253](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L243-L253)

```solidity
    // Premium tier
    // - High liquidity for stable price discovery
@>>>// - 0.1 ETH initial liquidity @audit requires 0.1 ether as initial liquidity
    // - 10,000 votes each for trust/distrust (highly stable price)
    marketConfigs.push(
      MarketConfig({
@>>>    initialLiquidity: 100 * DEFAULT_PRICE, //@audit - default price is 0.01 ether, i.e initial liquidity is 0.01 * 100 = 1 ether instead of 0.1 ether as mentioned in docs above
        initialVotes: 10000,
        basePrice: DEFAULT_PRICE
      }) 
    );
```

Now, since the initialLiquidity is setup incorrectly, thus when the [`_createMarket()`]() is triggred by either users calling `createMarketWithConfig` or admins calling `createMarketWithConfigAdmin`, they overpay by `10x`, due to incorrect setting of `initialLiquidity`.

```solidity
    // ensure the user has provided enough initial liquidity
    uint256 initialLiquidityRequired = marketConfigs[marketConfigIndex].initialLiquidity;
@>>>if (msg.value < initialLiquidityRequired) { // @audit - massive overpayment, due to incorrect initial liquidity 
      revert InsufficientInitialLiquidity();
    }
```

### Impact

Default Market configuration is incorrectly set, leading to massive overpayment by users when creating market with that config

### Mitigation

Update `DEFAULT_PRICE` to `0.001 ether` to match the required `initialLiquidity` for market configurations.
