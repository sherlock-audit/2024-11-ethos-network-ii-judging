# Corruptible Upgradability Pattern

### Summary

The EthosContracts (EthosVouch, ReputationMarket) are UUPSUpgradeable. However, the current implementation has multiple issues regarding upgradability.

### Root Cause

Following is the inheritance chain of the EthosContracts.

    AccessControl:::nogap-->AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable:::nogap
    AccessControl:::nogap-->SignatureControl:::nogap
    EthosVouch:::nogap-->AccessControl:::nogap
    ReputationMarket:::nogap-->AccessControl:::nogap
```

The Ethos contracts are meant to be upgradeable. However, it inherits contracts that are not upgrade-safe.

The `AccessControl` and `SignatureControl` , `EthosVouch` , `ReputatoinMarket` are contracts written by Ethos team, and contain storage slots but there are no gaps implemented.

### Internal pre-conditions

If admin performs an upgrade and wants to add another storage slot in AccessControl or SignatureControl, EthosVouch, ReputatoinMarket contracts, the storage slot would mess up.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact
