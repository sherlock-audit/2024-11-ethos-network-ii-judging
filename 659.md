# Incorrect calculation of marketFunds in sellVotes

### Summary

The `marketFunds` variable in the `sellVotes` function is incorrectly updated. It is adjusted by subtracting `fundsReceived` from `marketFunds`. However, a portion of the market's funds is transferred as a protocol exit fee, and this fee amount is not deducted from `marketFunds`. As a result, `marketFunds` becomes overestimated over time, potentially leading to excessive withdrawals through `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` after the market graduates.  

**Note:** This issue is different from the over-calculation of `marketFunds` in the `buyVotes` function. While both lead to the same impact, their root causes are different.

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket.sol:522](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L522) the fundsReceived value is subtracted from marketFunds. However, the protocol fee, which is part of marketFunds and is transferred to the protocol fee recipient, is not subtracted. This results in an over-calculation of marketFunds.

### Attack Path

#### **Initial Setup**
1. A market is created with a specific `profileId`, and voting begins.
2. Multiple users participate in the market by calling the `buyVotes` function, providing funds to purchase votes.

---

#### **Execution**
1. **User A** buys votes by calling `buyVotes`. The `_calculateBuy` function calculates the amount of funds being added to the market and updates `marketFunds` accordingly.  
2. Later, **User A** calls `sellVotes` to sell their votes. The `sellVotes` function applies an exit fee, transfers funds to the user, and subtracts the transferred funds from `marketFunds`. However, it doesn't subtract the exit fee from `marketFunds`, even though the fee is part of the market funds.
---

#### **Graduation and Withdrawal**
1. After the market ends, the market graduates, making `marketFunds` available for withdrawal via `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds`.
2. Authorized address calls `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds`, it withdraws amounts based on the inflated `marketFunds` value.
4. However, the underlying market does not have sufficient funds to match the marketFunds value. As a result, the protocol is forced to cover the shortfall using funds from other markets.
5.  The contract does not have sufficient funds to cover all markets. Eventually, it runs out of funds at some point.

### Impact

Excessive withdrawals through `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` leads to protocol insolvency, leaving the protocol without sufficient funds to cover all markets.
