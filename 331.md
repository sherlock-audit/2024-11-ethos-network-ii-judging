# Users pay less than the vouchersPoolFee due when the `increaseVouch` function is called

### Summary

The [`increaseVouch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426) function allows the user to increase the vouch.balance.

However, the fees in the `applyFees` function are subtracted from the amount he wants to deposit
```solidity
function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable nonReentrant {
    // vouch increases much also meet the minimum vouch amount
    if (msg.value < configuredMinimumVouchAmount) {
      revert MinimumVouchAmount(configuredMinimumVouchAmount);
    }
    // get the profile id of the author
    uint256 profileId = IEthosProfile(
      contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
    ).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);
    _vouchShouldBelongToAuthor(vouchId, profileId);
    // make sure this vouch is active; not unvouched
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);

    uint256 subjectProfileId = vouches[vouchId].subjectProfileId;
    (uint256 toDeposit, ) = applyFees(msg.value, true, subjectProfileId);
    vouches[vouchId].balance += toDeposit;

    emit VouchIncreased(vouchId, profileId, subjectProfileId, msg.value);
  }
```

The applyFees function will take three different fees from msg.value.

- protocolFee
- donationFee
- vouchersPoolFee

We're interested in vouchersPoolFee.

It is distributed among all vouchers of a given subjectProfileId

```solidity
function _rewardPreviousVouchers(
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 subjectProfileId
  ) internal returns (uint256 amountDistributed) {
    uint256[] storage vouchIds = vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId];
    uint256 totalVouches = vouchIds.length;

    // Calculate total balance of all active vouches
    uint256 totalBalance;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalVouches; i++) {
      Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];
      // Only include active (not archived) vouches in the distribution
      if (!vouch.archived) {
        totalBalance += vouch.balance;
      }
    }

    // If this is the first voucher, do not distribute rewards
    if (totalBalance == 0) {
      return totalBalance;
    }

    // Distribute rewards proportionally
    uint256 remainingRewards = amount;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalVouches && remainingRewards > 0; i++) {
      Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];
      if (!vouch.archived) {
        // Calculate this vouch's share of the rewards
        uint256 reward = amount.mulDiv(vouch.balance, totalBalance, Math.Rounding.Floor);
        if (reward > 0) {
          vouch.balance += reward;
          remainingRewards -= reward;
        }
      }
    }

    // Send any dust (remaining rewards due to rounding) to the subject reward escrow
    if (remainingRewards > 0) {
      _depositRewards(remainingRewards, subjectProfileId);
    }

    return amount;
  }
```
However, the function does not take into account in the distribution of the commission that this author is also among the vouches. That is, he receives a proportional share of the total pool in this commission. Thus, he reduces it for himself.


### Root Cause

_rewardPreviousVouchers  doesn't take into account that the author of the vouch may also be among the previous vouchers

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Let's say there are now two Vouch
[Author 1:100, Author 2:10]

Author 1 decides to increase his vouch by another 100, let's say the commission for previousVouchers is 11%, so he has to pay 11.

The 11 will be distributed between the two authors as 10, 1.

So the commission distribution that will be in reality is as follows

Author 1: 10
Author 2: 1

Although it should be:
Author 2: 11

### Impact

Incorrect allocation of commissions. Users are losing funds that they could have gotten

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check that you don't count the vouch author in the commission allocation
