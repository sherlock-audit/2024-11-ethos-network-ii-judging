# There's no slippage protection when selling votes

### Summary
As the vote price is constantly changing based on the vote buys/ sells, `buyVotes` has correctly implemented a slippage protection, to make sure users do receive less than what they expect. However, the same logic is not implemented for when the user is selling their votes

```solidity
  function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // calculate the amount of votes to sell and the funds received
    (
      uint256 votesSold,
      uint256 fundsReceived,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);

    // update the market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;

    // apply protocol fees
    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

    // send the proceeds to the seller
    _sendEth(fundsReceived);
    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
    emit VotesSold(
      profileId,
      msg.sender,
      isPositive,
      votesSold,
      fundsReceived,
      block.timestamp,
      minVotePrice,
      maxVotePrice
    );
    _emitMarketUpdate(profileId);
  }
```

For this reason, due to price spikes and/or MEV, user might actually receive significantly less funds than expected, resulting in a direct loss of funds.

### Root Cause
Lack of slippage protection 

### Attack Path
1. User calls `sellVotes`
2. Right before their tx executes, a whale dumps a lot of votes, dropping the price significantly.
3. User's tx executes at price significantly lower than usual
4. After the user's tx, price goes back to normal
5. User is at a loss.

### Impact
Loss of funds

### Mitigation
Add slippage protection to `sellVotes`
