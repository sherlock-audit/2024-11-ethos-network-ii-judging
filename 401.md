# compromised authorAddresses will be able to unvouch some profileid vouches

### Summary
Users of EthosProfiles are encouraged to register different addresses with their profile ID, However if an address get compromised it will be able to call `unvouch` and gets balances of vouches has been done with this address without any restrictions, as it only check that `authorAddresse` of vouch is msg.sender and don't check if it was compromised or not.

[checking only for msg.sender at `unvouch()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L459C1-L461C6)

### Recommendations
revert when a compromised address try to call `unvouch()` and implement function to handle such vouches are done by compromised address.
