# Users are exposed to price volatility without protection in sellVotes

### Summary

The `sellVotes` function does not include any slippage checks, unlike the buyVotes function. Users could receive significantly less ETH than expected due to price slippage during the transaction.

### Root Cause

no slippage protection like in buyVotes
```solidity
  function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
 
```

### Impact

Users are exposed to price volatility without protection, which could lead to unexpected losses.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Introduce slippage parameters to the sellVotes function, allowing users to specify the minimum acceptable funds to receive. This protects users from adverse price movements during the transaction.

```solidity
function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 minExpectedFunds,
    uint256 slippageBasisPoints
) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    // Existing code...

    // Slippage check
    _checkSlippageLimit(fundsReceived, minExpectedFunds, slippageBasisPoints);

    // Existing code...
}
```
