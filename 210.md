# slashing amount is calculated incorrectly leading to protocol loss

### Summary

The method `slash()` slashes `slashBasisPoints` from each vouch. But the slash amount is calculated on ***vouch.balance***. Which is not the total amount. Instead it has multiple fees deducted from it. Also, the rounding is in the favour of the user and not the protocol.

```solidity
uint256 slashAmount = vouch.balance.mulDiv(
          slashBasisPoints,
          BASIS_POINT_SCALE,
          Math.Rounding.Floor
        );
```

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The calculated ***slashAmount*** will be less as firstly we are calculating slashAmount on `vouch.balance`. Secondly, the rounding is not in the favour of the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The ***slashAmount*** should be calculated as follows:

```solidity
uint256 slashAmount = vouch.balance.mulDiv(
          slashBasisPoints,
          (BASIS_POINT_SCALE - entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints - entryDonationFeeBasisPoints - entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints),
          Math.Rounding.Ceil
        );

```
