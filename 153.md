# Discrepancy in Fee Inclusion for Buy and Sell Operations in Market Funds Tracking

### Summary

During the buyVotes operation, the protocol includes both fees and donations in the funds added to the marketFunds mapping, as stated by the team [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L111), the mapping is expected to track the total funds invested for a given profileId, but during the [buyVotes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481), the [protocolFee, and donation were added](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L978) as part of the investment. However, during [sellVotes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1041), the fundsReceived calculation reflects only the actual funds the seller receives, [excluding fees](    funds = amount - protocolFee - donation;).

This discrepancy creates an inaccurate representation of the funds attributed to marketFunds, leading to overestimation when buying votes and potential discrepancies when assessing overall market activity or user investments. The issue arises because the fundsPaid during buyVotes is calculated as:
```solidity
fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;
```


### Root Cause

During buyVotes, the protocol includes fees in fundsPaid and attributes this total to marketFunds[profileId].


### Impact

Market funds (marketFunds) overestimate the funds attributed to users during buy operations.

### PoC

	•	Buy Operation: User deposits 1.5 ETH.
	•	Vote price: 1 ETH.
	•	Protocol fee: 0.01 ETH.
	•	Donation: 0.01 ETH.
	•	marketFunds[profileId] increases by 1.02 ETH (including fees and donations).

	•	Sell Operation: User sells a vote for 1 ETH.
	•	Protocol fee: 0.01 ETH.
	•	Funds received: 0.99 ETH.
	•	Only 0.99 ETH is deducted or tracked in marketFunds[profileId].

Market funds indicate inflated investments for buys but lower-than-expected reductions for sells.

### Mitigation

Modify the logic in buyVotes to ensure only the vote price (exclusive of fees) is added to marketFunds[profileId].
```solidity
uint256 fundsToTrack = fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation;
marketFunds[profileId] += fundsToTrack;
```

```solidity
  function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // other codes here
    // tally market funds
    if (fundsReceived > marketFunds[profileId]) {
      marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
    } else {
      marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
    }
    // other code here
  }
```
