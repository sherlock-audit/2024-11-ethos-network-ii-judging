# Earn rewards as donation for mock profiles cannot be claimed

### Summary

`EthosVouch.sol` allows authors, vouching to mock profiles, however, the donation collected from the vouching is not claimable. 

### Root Cause

EthosVouch support staked based trust relationships b/w profiles, where one profile(author) vouches for another profile(subject). Consider, an author stake ETH to a subject profile simply via call to `vouchByAddress/vouchByProfileId()` function. The function perform some checks related the subject profiles, where it required `subjectProfileId` either to verified or mock,
```solidity
    // you may not vouch for archived profiles
    // however, you may vouch for verified AND mock profiles
    // we allow vouching for mock profiles in case they are later verified
    if (archived || (!mock && !verified)) {
      revert InvalidEthosProfileForVouch(subjectProfileId);
    }
```
further `applyFee()` get called, where, along with the `protocolFee` and `vouchersPoolFee`, a portion of the stake is collected as a `donationFee`,

```solidity
  function applyFees(
    uint256 amount,
    bool isEntry,
    uint256 subjectProfileId
  ) internal returns (uint256 toDeposit, uint256 totalFees) {
    if (isEntry) {
      // Calculate entry fees
      uint256 protocolFee = calcFee(amount, entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints);
      uint256 donationFee = calcFee(amount, entryDonationFeeBasisPoints);
      uint256 vouchersPoolFee = calcFee(amount, entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints);

      // Distribute fees
      if (protocolFee > 0) {
        _depositProtocolFee(protocolFee);
      }
      if (donationFee > 0) {
        _depositRewards(donationFee, subjectProfileId);   // @audit: cached donationFee for later claim
      }
```
this donation `amount` is cached to `subjectAddress` in a mapping by `_depositRewards()` function,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L688
```solidity 
  function _depositRewards(uint256 amount, uint256 recipientProfileId) internal {
    rewards[recipientProfileId] += amount;
    emit DepositedToRewards(recipientProfileId, amount);
  }
```

which is claimable later via `claimRewards()` call by subjectAddress. Notice that the author can vouch to mock profiles as it is allowed, however, the `claimRewards()` function below reverts if rewards are being claimed from the mock profiles,
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L667
```solidity
  function claimRewards() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    (bool verified, , bool mock, uint256 callerProfileId) = IEthosProfile(
      contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
    ).profileStatusByAddress(msg.sender);

    // Only check that this is a real profile (not mock) and was verified at some point
    if (!verified || mock) {         // @audit: revert if mock
      revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(msg.sender);
    }

    uint256 amount = rewards[callerProfileId];
    if (amount == 0) revert InsufficientRewardsBalance();

    rewards[callerProfileId] = 0;
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: amount }("");
    if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Rewards claim failed");

    emit WithdrawnFromRewards(callerProfileId, amount);
```
,causing the subject address unable to claim their rewards, earned as donations.
### Impact
Reward earn as donation cannot be claimed. 

### Mitigation
Allow for mock profiles owners(subjects) to `claimRewards()` in case they can't be verified, or add an additional function where the rewards earn as a donation can be claimed by owner for mock profiles.
