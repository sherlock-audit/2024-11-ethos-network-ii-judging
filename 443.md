# The design inconsistency in `increaseVouch` and `unvouvh()`.

### Summary

The current design allows holders of the same `profileId` to increase a vouch created by other holders with the same `profileId`.

However, only the vouch creator can unvouch, and the vouch creator retains all unvouched funds.

This mechanism poses a potential risk of fund loss for those who increase the vouch.

### Root Cause

In the `increaseVouch` function, any account who has the same `profileId` with the vouch creator.

```solidity
24:     uint256 profileId = IEthosProfile(
25:       contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
26:     ).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);
27:     _vouchShouldBelongToAuthor(vouchId, profileId);
```

However, the `unvouch()` function can only be called by the vouch creator.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L456-L461
```solidity
456:    // because it's $$$, you can only withdraw/unvouch to the same address you used to vouch
457:    // however, we don't care about the status of the address's profile; funds are always attached
458:    // to an address, not a profile
459:     if (vouches[vouchId].authorAddress != msg.sender) {
460:       revert AddressNotVouchAuthor(vouchId, msg.sender, vouches[vouchId].authorAddress);
461:     }
```

The comment says that funds are always attached not a profile, which is contradict with the fact that `increaseVouch` can be called by 
any account who has the same `profileId` with the vouch creator.
