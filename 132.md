# Voucher Pool Fee Exploit via Minimal Initial Contribution

### Summary

The design of the fee distribution mechanism for `voucherPoolFee` allows users to gain a disproportionate benefit by creating an initial minimal vouch and then increasing the amount later. This manipulation undermines the fairness of the fee distribution model and can lead to an inequitable allocation of rewards.



### Root Cause

The exploit arises from the fact that the user becomes eligible for a share of the `voucherPoolFee` as soon as they create a vouch, regardless of its size. By first contributing a minimal amount, they avoid contributing a substantial fee while still qualifying for a share of subsequent distributions.

User calls `vouchByProfileId` function at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L330C12-L330C28

Note that this function fetches `toDeposit` by calling the `applyFee` function internally at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L384

```Solidity
    (uint256 toDeposit, ) = applyFees(msg.value, true, subjectProfileId);
```

So, the `applyFees` function is called at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L929

```Solidity
  function applyFees(
    uint256 amount,
    bool isEntry,
    uint256 subjectProfileId
  ) internal returns (uint256 toDeposit, uint256 totalFees) {
    if (isEntry) {
      // Calculate entry fees
      uint256 protocolFee = calcFee(amount, entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints);
      uint256 donationFee = calcFee(amount, entryDonationFeeBasisPoints);
      uint256 vouchersPoolFee = calcFee(amount, entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints);

      // Distribute fees
      if (protocolFee > 0) {
        _depositProtocolFee(protocolFee);
      }
      if (donationFee > 0) {
        _depositRewards(donationFee, subjectProfileId);
      }
      if (vouchersPoolFee > 0) {
        // update the voucher pool fee to the amount actually distributed
        vouchersPoolFee = _rewardPreviousVouchers(vouchersPoolFee, subjectProfileId);
      }
      totalFees = protocolFee + donationFee + vouchersPoolFee;
      toDeposit = amount - totalFees;
    } else {
      // Calculate and apply exit fee
      uint256 exitFee = calcFee(amount, exitFeeBasisPoints);

      if (exitFee > 0) {
        _depositProtocolFee(exitFee);
      }
      totalFees = exitFee;
      toDeposit = amount - exitFee;
    }

    return (toDeposit, totalFees);
  }
```

So, there are three types of fees at entry : `protocolFee`, `donationFee`, and `vouchersPoolFee`.
`protocolFee` goes to the protocol.
`donationFee` goes to the `subjectProfileId`.
`vouchersPoolFee` goes to the previous vouchers by calling `_rewardPreviousVouchers`.

`_rewardPreviousVouchers` is called at  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L697

```Solidity
  function _rewardPreviousVouchers(
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 subjectProfileId
  ) internal returns (uint256 amountDistributed) {
    uint256[] storage vouchIds = vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId];
    uint256 totalVouches = vouchIds.length;

    // Calculate total balance of all active vouches
    uint256 totalBalance;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalVouches; i++) {
      Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];
      // Only include active (not archived) vouches in the distribution
      if (!vouch.archived) {
        totalBalance += vouch.balance;
      }
    }

    // If this is the first voucher, do not distribute rewards
    if (totalBalance == 0) {
      return totalBalance;
    }

    // Distribute rewards proportionally
    uint256 remainingRewards = amount;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalVouches && remainingRewards > 0; i++) {
      Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];
      if (!vouch.archived) {
        // Calculate this vouch's share of the rewards
        uint256 reward = amount.mulDiv(vouch.balance, totalBalance, Math.Rounding.Floor);
        if (reward > 0) {
          vouch.balance += reward;
          remainingRewards -= reward;
        }
      }
    }
```
So, the `voucherPoolFee` is distributed proportionally to all other already existing vouches in that pool.

After successfully transferring all the fees, the `vouchByProfileId` finally successfully finishes execution by updating all the mappings and structs. So, now the vouch is created for that user.

However, now if that user calls the `increaseVouch` function at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426 , 
again all these fees are applied at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L440 

```Solidity
   (uint256 toDeposit, ) = applyFees(msg.value, true, subjectProfileId);
```

However, this time the user saves some ETH as `_rewardPreviousVouchers` distributes some ETH to this user also.

### Internal pre-conditions

* `vouchByProfileId` adds the user's vouch to the pool.
* `voucherPoolFee` is distributed to all active vouches, including those with minimal balances on calling `increaseVouch` function

### External pre-conditions

* The user creates an initial vouch with a minimal contribution (e.g., 0.0001 ETH).
* The user subsequently increases their vouch amount through `increaseVouch` to a significant value.

### Attack Path

* The attacker creates a vouch with the minimum allowed ETH (e.g., 0.0001 ETH).
* This vouch makes the user eligible for rewards distributed through voucherPoolFee.
* The attacker increases their vouch amount significantly (e.g., 2 ETH).
* The attacker benefits from the `voucherPoolFee` without contributing proportionally, saving ETH.

### Impact

* The attacker avoids a portion of the `voucherPoolFee` while still benefiting from its distribution.
* Other participants in the vouch pool receive less than their fair share of rewards, undermining trust in the system.

### PoC

* `EthosVouch.sol` contract is deployed with a `voucherPoolFeeBasisPoints` set to a realistic percentage.
* Create a vouch with 0.0001 ETH (whatever minimal ETH allowed).
* Verify that the user is now part of the vouch pool.
* Now call `increaseVouch` function.
* Observe that the user receives a share of the `voucherPoolFee` from their own significant contribution.

### Mitigation

Update the `_rewardPreviousVouchers` function for proper and proportional distribution of `voucherPoolFee`
