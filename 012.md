# Fee calculation vulnerability will overcharge users during vote purchases

## **Summary**
The `_calculateBuy` function calculates fees (`protocolFee` and `donation`) using `msg.value` instead of the actual funds utilized for the purchase (`fundsPaid`). This results in users being overcharged if `msg.value` exceeds the amount needed to purchase the intended vote, and users who provide more ETH than needed to make the purchase lose more.

## **Root Cause**
The root cause lies in the misalignment between the fee calculation basis and the actual funds used:
- **Fee Basis Mismatch**: Fees are derived from `msg.value` (total ETH sent) rather than `fundsPaid` (ETH actually spent for votes).
- **Implementation Error**: The call to `previewFees` uses `funds` (mapped to `msg.value`) without adjusting for the actual paid funds.

## **Impact**
  - **Overpayment**: Users providing excess ETH are charged disproportionately high fees, leading to financial inefficiency and user dissatisfaction.

## **Proof of Concept (PoC)**

1. **Setup**
   - Assume UserA with `msg.value = 10 ETH`, UserB with `msg.value = 9 ETH`
   - Number of votes to buy = 5 votes.
   - `fundsPaid` required for 5 votes = 8 ETH.(Assume that the number of votes that UserA and UserB can buy with the funds they pays is at most 5. In other words, since buying 6 votes requires 11 ETH, users can only buy 5 votes.)
   - Fee rate = 10%.

2. **Execution**
   - Fees are calculated on `msg.value`:
   UserA: `protocolFee = 1 ETH`
   UserB: `protocolFee = 0.9 ETH`
   - Actual funds used (`fundsPaid`) for votes:
     `fundsPaid = 8 ETH` (UserA and UserB are the same.)
   - Total paid:
   UserA: `totalPaid = 9 ETH`, `overPaid = 9 - 8 - 8 * 0.1 = 0.2 ETH`
   UserB: `totalPaid = 8.9 ETH`, `overPaid = 8.9 - 8 - 8 * 0.1 = 0.1 ETH`


3. **Observed Behavior**
   - UserA and UserB spent more than necessary.
   - UserA and UserB bought the same number of votes, but UserA paid more than UserB.

## **Mitigation**

To address the identified issue in `_calculateBuy`, the fee calculation logic should be corrected to ensure that fees are proportional to the actual funds spent on purchasing votes. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step mitigation strategy:
**(The same as the `calcFee` function of `EthosVouch` contract.)**

1. **Update calculation logic of `fundsAvailable`:**
     ```solidity
     fundsAvailable = funds * BASIS_POINTS_BASE / (BASIS_POINTS_BASE + entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints + donationBasisPoints)
     ```
2. **After the loop, calculate the final `protocolFee` and `donation` for the total `fundsPaid`**:
     ```solidity
     (protocolFee, donation) = previewFees(fundsPaid, true);
     fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;
     ```
