### Root Cause

The `sellVotes` function located in `ReputationMarket.sol:495` misses to implement slippage protection. This means that it can be targeted by malicious actors and a sandwich attack can occur. What is more, a simple price movement may cause loss of funds for users.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User A calls `sellVotes`.
2. Malicious user front-runs the call to `sellVotes` causing a price movement.
3. Malicious user back-runs the call to `sellVotes` gaining value while user A loses.


### Impact

The user loses while selling votes.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

There is a slippage protection already implemented in the `buyVotes` function. A similar approach should be used to fix this issue.
