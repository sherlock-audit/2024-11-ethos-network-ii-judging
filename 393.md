# Created markets could have a different config than intended if admin removes one

### Summary

When users try to create a market with a config that the admin has just removed, users could have a market created with a different config instead of the intended one.

### Root Cause

I think the root cause of this issue would be the implemented market configs storage. Market configs are held in an array without any information on the configs' statuses. When admin removes a config it just gets swapped with the last config in the array (if the one being removed is not last already).
```solidity
  struct MarketConfig {
    uint256 initialLiquidity;
    uint256 initialVotes;
    uint256 basePrice;
  }
  MarketConfig[] public marketConfigs;
```

```solidity
  function removeMarketConfig(uint256 configIndex) public onlyAdmin whenNotPaused {
    // Cannot remove if only one config remains
    if (marketConfigs.length <= 1) {
      revert InvalidMarketConfigOption("Must keep one config");
    }

    // Check if the index is valid
    if (configIndex >= marketConfigs.length) {
      revert InvalidMarketConfigOption("index not found");
    }

    emit MarketConfigRemoved(configIndex, marketConfigs[configIndex]);

    // If this is not the last element, swap with the last element
    uint256 lastIndex = marketConfigs.length - 1;
    if (configIndex != lastIndex) {
      marketConfigs[configIndex] = marketConfigs[lastIndex];
    }

    // Remove the last element
    marketConfigs.pop();
  }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin removes a config that is:
- not last in the marketConfigs[] array
- has initialLiquidity not less than initialLiquidity of the config last in array

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

A user unknowingly creates a market with a config right after an admin removes that config

### Impact

The user gets a market with a different config than the one they intended. Since configs can not be changed and users can only have 1 market for their profile ever, this mistake is irreversible. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

For example change the way configs are stored, implement checks if the configs are active and revert transactions that try to use removed configs.
