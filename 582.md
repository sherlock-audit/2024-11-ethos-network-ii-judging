# total fees can go beyond 10% due to wrong initialization of variable MAX_TOTAL_FEES

### Summary

In readme "Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%" is there, but while initializing it is wrongly initialised to 100%.
So in the function checkFeeExceedsMaximum(), total fees > MAX_TOTAL_FEES is checked. 

so it go beyond 10% as MAX_TOTAL_FEES is set to 10000.
