# The invariant that maximum total fees cannot exceed 10% in `EthosVouch` might be broken

### Summary

According to [README.MD](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii?tab=readme-ov-file#q-are-there-any-limitations-on-values-set-by-admins-or-other-roles-in-the-codebase-including-restrictions-on-array-lengths), the sponsor stated that:
> Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%

Th total fees in `EthosVouch` is composed of several fees:
```math
\begin{align*}
fees_{total} &= fees_{entry} + fees_{exit} \\
fees_{entry} &= fee_{protocol} + fee_{donation} + fee_{vouchersPool} \\
\end{align*}
```
Every time when a fee is changed, it will ensure that $fees_{total}$ can not exceed `10%`:
```solidity
  function checkFeeExceedsMaximum(uint256 currentFee, uint256 newFee) internal view {
    uint256 totalFees = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints +
      exitFeeBasisPoints +
      entryDonationFeeBasisPoints +
      entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints +
      newFee -
      currentFee;
    if (totalFees > MAX_TOTAL_FEES) revert FeesExceedMaximum(totalFees, MAX_TOTAL_FEES);
  }
```

If an author want to vouch `100 ETH`, the total fees they will pay should no more than `10 ETH`, which includes entry fees and exit fees.

However, this design could be broken since the entry fees and exit fees are paid separately. 


### Root Cause

The entry fees and exit fees are paid separately.  All fees could be changed after an author pay their entry fees.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Alice want to vouch `100 ETH` by sending `107 ETH`:
```math
\begin{align*}
bips_{protocol} &= 1\% \\
bips_{donation} &= 2\% \\
bips_{vouchersPool} &= 4\% \\
bips_{exit} &= 3\% \\
amount_{vouch} &= 100 ETH \\
\\
fees_{entry} &= fee_{protocol} + fee_{donation} + fee_{vouchersPool} \\
&= amount_{vouch} *bips_{protocol} + amount_{vouch} *bips_{donation} + amount_{vouch} * bips_{vouchersPool} \\
&= 100 ETH * 1\% + 100 ETH  * 2\% + 100 ETH  * 4\% \\
&= 7 ETH
\\
fees_{exit} &= amount_{vouch} * bips_{exit} \\
&= 100 ETH * 3\% \\
&= 3 ETH \\
\end{align*}
```
As we can see, after paying `7 ETH`, Alice should pay no more than `3 ETH` when she exit by calling `unvouch()`.

However, all above fees could be changed before the author exits their vouch, e.g. all values are updated as below:
```math
\begin{align*}
bips_{protocol} &= 1\% \\
bips_{donation} &= 2\% \\
bips_{vouchersPool} &= 1\% \\
bips_{exit} &= 6\% \\
\end{align*}
```
If Alice exit her vouch now, she need pay `6 ETH` as exit fees:
```math
\begin{align*}
fees_{exit} &= amount_{vouch} * bips_{exit} \\
&= 100 ETH * 6\% \\
&= 6 ETH \\
\end{align*}
```

The total fees Alice paid will exceed `10%` of her vouch value, resulting the invariant being broken

### Impact

An author might pay fees more than `10%` because the entry fees and exit fees are paid separately. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Entry and exit fees should have separate cap limitations since they are paid separately.
