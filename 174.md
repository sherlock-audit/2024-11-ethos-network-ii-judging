# Maximum Total Fees on the `EthosVouch` Contract Can Often Be Exceeded.

### Summary

> - For both contracts:
> Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%

However, the total fees on the `EthosVouch` contract can often be exceeded.
As we know the sum of `exitFeeBasisPoints`, `entryDonationFeeBasisPoints`, `entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints` and `entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints` can't be exceed `MAX_TOTAL_FEES`, which is set at 10,000.

**Example 1:** An admin can set all basis points to 400 without considering the implications.
In this case, when vouching with x ether, the total fees are calculated as follows:
`3 * (x - x * 10,000 / (10,000 + 400)) = x * 1,200 / 10,400 ≈ 0.115x.`
The result shows that the total fees exceed 10% of the total amount when vouching (it is approximately 11%).

Now, let’s look at a more concerning case.
**Example 2:** An admin can also set all basis points to 2,500 without considering the implications. In this case, when vouching, the total fees amount to 60% of the total amount.
This could lead to a loss of reputation among users.

### Mitigation

Update of [MAX_TOTAL_FEES](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120).
```solidity
-   uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
```
```solidity
+   uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1111;
```
why 1111?
```solidity
    /*
     * Formula derivation:
     * 1. total = deposit + total fee
     * 2. total fee = deposit * (allFeesBasisPoints/10000)
     * allFeesBasisPoints is entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints + entryDonationFeeBasisPoints + entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints when vouches
     * 3. total = deposit + deposit * (allFeesBasisPoints/10000)
     * 4. total = deposit * (1 + allFeesBasisPoints/10000)
     * 5. deposit = total / (1 + allFeesBasisPoints/10000)
     * 6. total fee = total - deposit
     * 7. total fee = total - (total * 10000 / (10000 + allFeesBasisPoints))
     * total fee <= total / 10
     * The variable of allFeesBasisPoints can be MAX_TOTAL_FEES.
     * total - (total * 10000 / (10000 + MAX_TOTAL_FEES)) <= total / 10
     * total(1 - 10000 / (10000 + MAX_TOTAL_FEES)) <= total / 10
     * MAX_TOTAL_FEES / (10000 + MAX_TOTAL_FEES) <= 1/10
     * MAX_TOTAL_FEES <= (10000 + MAX_TOTAL_FEES) / 10
     * 9 * MAX_TOTAL_FEES <= 10000
     * MAX_TOTAL_FEES <= 10000 / 9
     * 10000 / 9 ≈ 1111, 1111 < 10000 / 9 so we can suppose MAX_TOTAL_FEES < 1111
     * The calculated value of 10000 / 9 is approximately 1111. Therefore, we can conclude that MAX_TOTAL_FEES should be less than or equal to 1111 to satisfy the fee constraint.

But there is another issue for this.
There is an issue with the current fee calculation logic. Currently, we calculate each fee separately, as demonstrated [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L936-L938)
This can lead to situations where the total fees exceed the intended limit.
**Example Scenario:**
If the admin sets the following values:
-   `entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints` = 370
-   `entryDonationFeeBasisPoints` = 370
-   `entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints` = 370
-   `exitFeeBasisPoints` = 1
In this case, the total fees would be calculated as follows:
```solidity
/*
* totalFees = protocolFee + donationFee + vouchersPoolFee
* totalFees = total * entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints / (10000 + entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints)
*                 + total * entryDonationFeeBasisPoints/ (10000 + entryDonationFeeBasisPoints)
*                 + total * entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints/ (10000 + entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints)
* totalFees = total * (3 * 370 / 10370)
* totalFees = total * 0.107 (exceeds 10% of total)
*/
```
1. **One way is to Update Fee Calculation Logic:**
```solidity
-      uint256 protocolFee = calcFee(amount, entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints);
-      uint256 donationFee = calcFee(amount, entryDonationFeeBasisPoints);
-      uint256 vouchersPoolFee = calcFee(amount, entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints);
```
```solidity
+     uint256 protocolFee = (amount * entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints) / (entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints + entryDonationFeeBasisPoints + entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints)
+     uint256 donationFee = (amount * entryDonationFeeBasisPoints ) / (entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints + entryDonationFeeBasisPoints + entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints)
+     uint256 vouchersPoolFee = (amount * entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints) / (entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints + entryDonationFeeBasisPoints + entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints)
```
2. **Another way is to Set a Variable for Readability and Safety:**
To enhance readability and clarity, we can set a variable to a base value (e.g., 1000) for all fee calculations. This will also help prevent any potential overflow issues and make the calculations more intuitive.
