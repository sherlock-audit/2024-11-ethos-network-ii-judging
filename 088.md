# Vote sellers underpaid for votes

### Summary

When a vote seller sells their votes, the amount the seller receives is calculated in `_calculateSell` by calling `calcVotePrice`. The problem is that `calcVotePrice` is called after `market.votes[]` is updated, returning a price that's lower than what the user should actually receive for that vote.

### Root Cause

`market.vote[]` is updated before `_calcVotePrice()` is called.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A vote holder needs to call sellVotes() to sell their votes

### External pre-conditions

n/a

### Attack Path

1. Say there are 100 TRUST votes and 100 DISTRUST votes in a market
2. A vote seller wants to sell 1 TRUST vote
3. The price the vote seller receives for the vote should be the vote price (100 * basePrice / 200) minus the protocol fee
4. But instead, the vote seller will receive their vote for (99 * basePrice / 199) minus the protocol fee because markets.vote[] is updated before the vote price is calculated instead of after.

### Impact

Loss of funds for vote sellers because they never receive the full price per vote that they should actually receive.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the code in the while loop in `_calculateSell` to:

```diff
while (votesSold < amount) {
      if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
        revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
      }

-      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
-      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);

+      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
+      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;

      fundsReceived += votePrice;
      votesSold++;
    }

```
