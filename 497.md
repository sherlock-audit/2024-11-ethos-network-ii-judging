# `EthosVouch` inherited `AccessControl` contract is missing `init()` call for `PausableUpgradeable` and `AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable`

### Summary

`EthosVouch` follows the `UUPSUpgradeable` proxy pattern, and ensures to call `__accessControl_init` to properly set up access control for the inherited `AccessControl` contract:

[EthosVouch.sol#L259-L289](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L259-L289)
```javascript
 function initialize(
    address _owner,
    address _admin,
    address _expectedSigner,
    address _signatureVerifier,
    address _contractAddressManagerAddr,
    address _feeProtocolAddress,
    uint256 _entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints,
    uint256 _entryDonationFeeBasisPoints,
    uint256 _entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints,
    uint256 _exitFeeBasisPoints
  ) external initializer {
    __accessControl_init(
      _owner,
      _admin,
      _expectedSigner,
      _signatureVerifier,
      _contractAddressManagerAddr
    );

    __UUPSUpgradeable_init();
    ...
  }
```

Looking at `__accessControl_init`:

[AccessControl.sol#L45-L64](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/AccessControl.sol#L45-L64)
```javascript
  function __accessControl_init(
    address owner,
    address admin,
    address expectedSigner,
    address signatureVerifier,
    address contractAddressManagerAddr
  ) internal onlyInitializing {
    if (owner == address(0) || admin == address(0) || contractAddressManagerAddr == address(0)) {
      revert ZeroAddress();
    }

    __signatureControl_init(expectedSigner, signatureVerifier);

    contractAddressManager = IContractAddressManager(contractAddressManagerAddr);

    _grantRole(OWNER_ROLE, owner);
    _grantRole(ADMIN_ROLE, admin);

    // allowlistEnabled = false;
  }
```

It is missing [__AccessControlEnumerable_init()](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/access/extensions/AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable.sol#L31) and [__Pausable_init()](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/utils/PausableUpgradeable.sol#L56) calls. These must be called because they are inherited by `AccessControl` and used throughout the contract.

### Root Cause

Missing `__AccessControlEnumerable_init()` and `__Pausable_init()` calls while inheriting `PausableUpgradeable` and `AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable`

### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

N/A

### Impact

Corrupted upgradeability, failing to call parent initializers will lead to uninitialized state variables

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

Ensure to call `__Pausable_init()` and `__AccessControlEnumerable_init()` within `__accessControl_init`
