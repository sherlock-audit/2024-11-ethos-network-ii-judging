# Profile Unable to buy Votes in ReputationMarket due to wrong basePrice is set when initializing marketConfigs

### Summary

[marketConfigs.push()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L223-254) in `initialize()` is set to `DEFAULT_PRICE` instead of `MINIMUM_BASE_PRICE`

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket.sol:223-255](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L223-254) 3 MarketConfigs (Default, Premium & Deluxe) are initialized with a basePrice of `DEFAULT_PRICE (0.01ETH)` instead of `MINIMUM_BASE_PRICE (0.001ETH)`

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `ReputationMarket` is initialized with three `marketConfigs` with wrong basePrice

### External pre-conditions

No external pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. `ReputationMarket` is initialized with three `marketConfigs` with wrong basePrice
2. Profile calls `createMarketWithProfileId()` and a `marketConfigIndex`.
3. A market is created with wrong `basePrice` parameter

### Impact

A profile gets less votes or no votes at all when calling `buyVotes()` on a ReputationMarket due to wrong `basePrice`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Either reinitialize ReputationMarket implementation with the correct minimm basePrice set, or call `addMarketConfig()` to create new marketConfigs with the correct value
