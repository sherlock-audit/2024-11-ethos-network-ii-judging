# Seller will get less amount due to wrong calculation in `_calculateSell`

### Summary

- When user sells his votes by `sellVotes`, user should get the price of vote from current price and then change in price at every sell of vote.
- When first vote is sold, vote count is decreased and calculate the price again from updated count which decrease the price of votes. This is the normal calculation which protocol wants to implement and it is similar to `buyVotes` calculation.
- The problem occurs in `_calculateSell` function where firstly vote price is calculated for current count, then without increases `fundsReceived`  by current vote price, it decreases the count of vote which seller sells that means update the vote count.
- After that it calculate the vote price again with updated vote counts and this time it increases `fundsReceived` by vote price and this calculation continues for number of votes seller sells.

```solidity
function _calculateSell(
    Market memory market,
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  )
    private
    view
    returns (
      uint256 votesSold,
      uint256 fundsReceived,
      uint256 newVotePrice,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    )
  {
    ...
@>  uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);

    uint256 maxPrice = votePrice;
    uint256 minPrice;

    while (votesSold < amount) {
      if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
        revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
      }
@>    market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
@>    votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
@>    fundsReceived += votePrice;
      votesSold++;
    }
    ...
  }
```
- So this calculation does not account the current price of the vote at which seller sells the vote that means first vote sell will not count from current price but the price which comes after 1st vote count updates.
- And this is the sell calculation which means price decreases with every sell of vote that means seller will get less amount of eth than he should get due to wrong calculation in `_calculateSell`.

### Attack Path

### Impact

- Seller of the votes will get less amount of eth than he should get by selling his votes.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Protocol should make sure that current price of vote is accounted and `fundReceived` is updated with current price then only vote count should decrease. The calculation of buy votes is correct so refer that.
