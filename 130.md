# Malicious actor can fill all 256 vouch slots of profile with minimum vouch amounts

### Summary

Devs chose to limit number of vouches to 256 due to `constraints imposed by gas limits.` However this choice opens a griefing vulnerability.

In Ethos the total AMOUNT vouched represents your credibility, thus an attacker can fill all vouching slots with the minimum amount, and limit the credibility of profile owner.

While admin can increase `configuredMinimumVouchAmount`, this only makes the attack more expensive, while hurting regular users.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L372
```solidity
// don't exceed maximum vouches per subject profile
if (vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId].length >= maximumVouches) {
  revert MaximumVouchesExceeded(
    vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId].length,
    "Exceeds subject vouch limit"
  );
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

Attacker needs to create/self invite 256 accounts. Highly likely since social networks have millions of users.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Vouch 256 times with minimum amount from different addresses. Assuming default min vouch amount of `0.0001 eth`, attack would cost ~ `0.0256 eth`.

### Impact

Credibility of victim is limited by attacker.
