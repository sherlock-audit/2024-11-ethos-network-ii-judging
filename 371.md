# `sellVotes` does not remove from market funds, the protocol fee and donation amount

### Summary
```solidity
    (
      uint256 votesSold,
      uint256 fundsReceived,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);

    // update the market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;

    // apply protocol fees
    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

    // send the proceeds to the seller
    _sendEth(fundsReceived);
    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
```

Upon selling, the `_calculateSell` returns us the `fundsReceived` amount. This is the amount of funds the user has received. This is post-fees (does not include them).

As we can see `marketFunds` only deducts `fundsReceived`, therefore, does not deduct for the amount of funds going out as fees. As the funds are actually out of the market, this results in a double-spend upon market graduation.

### Root Cause
Wrong logic

### Attack Path
1. First vote is bought at 0.5eth. Market funds are increased by 0.5 eth.
2. Then, the user sells that same vote. Due to fees, `fundsReceived == 0.45eth`. 
3. The market only deducts 0.45 eth from its funds.
4. The market sends a total of 0.5 eth across the selling user, the protocol fee recipient and the donation recipient.

### Impact
Double spending.

### Mitigation

Deduct `fundsReceived + donation + protocolFee`
