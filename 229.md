# [M-1] Lack of storage Gap in Upgradeable contracts

## Summary:
While creating Upgradeable contracts, special care must be taken when dealing with storage slots. When the contract is upgraded in the future, the storage slots specifications remain same .

## Description:
`EthosVouch.sol` and `ReputationMarket.sol` both contracts are UUPS upgradeable meaning that they have the ability to be upgraded but they both are not using the storage gaps which can lead them to corruptible upgradeability/storage collision when upgraded.

Why Medium:
In `EthosVouch.sol` it uses nested structures to store data, which may complicate or make future upgrades impossible.
```javascript 
 struct Vouch {
    bool archived;
    bool unhealthy;
    uint256 authorProfileId;
    address authorAddress;
    uint256 vouchId;
    uint256 subjectProfileId;
    uint256 balance;
    string comment;
    string metadata;
    ActivityCheckpoints activityCheckpoints; // @audit: nested struct 
  }
```

Also, the `ReputationMarket.sol` contract has many storage variable and still doesn't uses storage gaps.

## Impact:
Storage of  `EthosVouch.sol` & `ReputationMarket.sol` contracts might be corrupted during an upgrade.

**Recommended Mitigation:** 
            To avoid collision with existing storage slots, a gap in storage is recommended for future upgrades.
```javascript
uint[40] private _gap;
```
