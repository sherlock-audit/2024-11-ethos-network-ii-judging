# Lack of slippage check in `ReputationMarket.sellVotes()`.

### Summary
The price of votes changes when votes are sold. However, there is no slippage check in the `ReputationMarket.sellVotes()` function, which could result in unexpected loss of fund to sellers.

### Root Cause
The price of votes changes when votes are sold. If someone sells the same kind of token before a seller, says `TRUST`, the subsequent seller will receive less funds than expected due to the decrease of price.

```solidity
      function _calcVotePrice(Market memory market, bool isPositive) private pure returns (uint256) {
        uint256 totalVotes = market.votes[TRUST] + market.votes[DISTRUST];
        return (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] * market.basePrice) / totalVotes;
      }
```

However, there is no slippage check in the `ReputationMarket.sellVotes()` function, which could result in unexpected loss of fund to sellers.
