# Vouch can be increased for a vouchid referencing an archived profile

### Summary

The protocol prevents users from vouching for an archived profile

However it does not stop users from increasing vouch (`increaseVouch`) for a vouch id that already references an archived profile.
This causes the rewards value for an archived subject profile id to still keep increasing. despite making restrictions

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426

The increase vouch function does not check if the recipient subject profile id is archived
