# Incorrect Accounting of Market Funds Enables Unauthorized Withdrawals via `GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL`

### Summary

Incorrect accounting of `marketFunds` in both `buyVotes` and `sellVotes` will cause unauthorized withdrawal of excess ETH when the `GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL` address executes the `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` function. An attacker can exploit this by manipulating vote transactions to artificially inflate or understate the `marketFunds` balance, allowing withdrawal of more ETH than exists in the contract.

### Root Cause

In `ReputationMarket.sol`, the `marketFunds` mapping is inaccurately updated:  
- **In [ReputationMarket.buyVotes: 481](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481):** `marketFunds[profileId]` is incremented by `fundsPaid`, which includes protocol fees and donations that are not added to the market's liquidity, leading to overstatement of funds.  
- **In [ReputationMarket.sellVotes: 522](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L522):** `marketFunds[profileId]` is decremented only by `fundsReceived`, which excludes protocol fees, leading to understatement of funds.  
These inaccuracies accumulate over time and directly affect the `marketFunds` balance.

### Internal pre-conditions

> Protocol fees and/or donations are set to non-zero values.
> The attacker can buy and sell votes in an active market.
> The attacker has sufficient ETH and owns votes.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker alternates between `buyVotes` and `sellVotes`.  
   - Each `buyVotes` call inflates `marketFunds[profileId]` by including protocol fees and donations.  
   - Each `sellVotes` call understates `marketFunds[profileId]` by excluding protocol fees.  
2. The attacker manipulates `marketFunds[profileId]` to a significant value.  
3. When the market is graduated, the `GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL` address triggers `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds`, withdrawing the artificially inflated `marketFunds[profileId]`.  

### Impact

**Severity:** High  
- Unauthorized withdrawal of ETH by the `GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL` address, leading to significant protocol fund loss.  
- Exploitation is feasible during regular market operations due to the inaccurate updates of `marketFunds`.

### PoC

Code Reference:
```solidity
// Incorrect accounting in buyVotes
marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid; // Includes fees that do not add liquidity to the market

// Incorrect accounting in sellVotes
marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived; // Excludes protocol fees, understating the liquidity

// Vulnerable function allowing unauthorized withdrawals
function withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(uint256 profileId) public whenNotPaused {
    address authorizedAddress = contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(
        "GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL"
    );
    if (msg.sender != authorizedAddress) {
        revert UnauthorizedWithdrawal();
    }
    _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]); // Withdraws inflated balance
    marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
}
```
### Mitigation
1. Adjust the `buyVotes` accounting logic to exclude protocol fees and donations from the market funds balance:  
   ```solidity
   uint256 netFundsAdded = fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation;
   marketFunds[profileId] += netFundsAdded;
   ```
2. Adjust the `sellVotes` accounting logic to include protocol fees in the funds removed:  
   ```solidity
   uint256 totalFundsRemoved = fundsReceived + protocolFee;
   marketFunds[profileId] -= totalFundsRemoved;
   ```
