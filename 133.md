# Missing `whenNotPaused` Modifier in `increaseVouch` Function in `EthosVouch.sol`

### Summary

The `increaseVouch` function does not include the `whenNotPaused` modifier, unlike other crucial functions in the smart contract. This omission allows users to call `increaseVouch` even when the contract is paused due to an emergency or attack. This could lead to further damage or misuse during such critical situations.

### Root Cause

The absence of the `whenNotPaused` modifier on the `increaseVouch` function bypasses the intended control mechanism designed to protect the contract during emergencies.

We can see that `increaseVouch` is an important function: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426-L444

```Solidity
  function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable nonReentrant {
    // vouch increases much also meet the minimum vouch amount
    if (msg.value < configuredMinimumVouchAmount) {
      revert MinimumVouchAmount(configuredMinimumVouchAmount);
    }
    // get the profile id of the author
    uint256 profileId = IEthosProfile(
      contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
    ).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);
    _vouchShouldBelongToAuthor(vouchId, profileId);
    // make sure this vouch is active; not unvouched
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);

    uint256 subjectProfileId = vouches[vouchId].subjectProfileId;
    (uint256 toDeposit, ) = applyFees(msg.value, true, subjectProfileId);
    vouches[vouchId].balance += toDeposit;

    emit VouchIncreased(vouchId, profileId, subjectProfileId, msg.value);
  }
```
However, this crucial function does not have a `whenNotPaused` modifier.

### Internal pre-conditions

* The contract includes a `whenNotPaused` modifier to restrict access to critical functions during emergencies.
* Most critical functions implement this modifier, except `increaseVouch`.


### External pre-conditions

* The contract is paused due to an attack, bug, or other emergency situations.
* A malicious or unaware user calls the `increaseVouch` function during this period.

### Attack Path

* The contract administrator pauses the contract to address a vulnerability or attack.
* A user calls the `increaseVouch` function, which is not restricted by the `whenNotPaused` modifier.
* This action could:
     * Introduce new vulnerabilities.
     * Allow exploitation of other components of the contract indirectly.
     * Undermine the administratorâ€™s ability to mitigate the emergency effectively.

### Impact

* Exploiting `increaseVouch` during a paused state can exacerbate existing vulnerabilities.
* It undermines the purpose of pausing the contract, limiting the effectiveness of emergency responses.
* Users and stakeholders may lose confidence in the contract's reliability and security mechanisms.

### PoC

* Pause this smart contract.
* Attempt to call `increaseVouch` while the contract is paused.
* Observe that the call is successful, bypassing the pause mechanism.





### Mitigation

Include the `whenNotPaused` modifier to the `increaseVouch` function to align it with the behavior of other critical functions.

```Solidity
function increaseVouch(uint256 subjectProfileId) external payable whenNotPaused {
    // Function logic
}
```
