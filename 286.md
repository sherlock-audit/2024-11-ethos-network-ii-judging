# No slippage protection in `sellVotes` function

## Root cause
The [sellVotes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L534) function in the `ReputationMarket` contract does not include slippage protection for sellers. This exposes them to unexpected changes in the amount of funds received (`fundsReceived`) due to market fluctuations before their transaction is executed.
```solidity 
function sellVotes(uint256 profileId, bool isPositive, uint256 amount) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // calculate the amount of votes to sell and the funds received
    (
      uint256 votesSold,
      uint256 fundsReceived,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);
    
    // update the market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;

    // apply protocol fees
    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

    // send the proceeds to the seller
    _sendEth(fundsReceived); // @audit No slippage protection
    
    // --SNIP
```
Since there is no slippage protection, the seller’s proceeds can vary significantly if market conditions change between the time the transaction is initiated and executed, especially in low-liquidity markets such as the Minimum Viable Liquidity market.

### Example Scenario:
- A market has `6` trust votes and `5` distrust votes for a given profileId.
- A user attempts to sell `1` trust vote and expects to receive `5/10 * basePrice = 0.0005 ether`.
- Before the user's transaction is executed, another user purchases `5` **distrust** votes.
- When the user’s transaction executes, the expected funds decrease to `5/15 * basePrice = 0.00033 ether`.
- This represents a **16.7%** reduction in the expected proceeds.

## Impact
Sellers may receive significantly less than anticipated for their votes, especially in markets with low liquidity.
## Internal pre-conditions
- None
## External pre-conditions
- None

## Mitigation
Implement slippage protection in the `sellVotes` function to ensure sellers have control over the minimum acceptable funds they are willing to receive.
