# During trading votes, the fees are overestimated by `previewFee()` function

### Summary

The protocol charges higher fee than the expected,

### Root Cause

Let's understand with a simple example, a user deposit `100 ether` in funds, including 10% as a totalFee. 

From user perspective, funds can be divided as, 
```solidity 
input_amount = actualDepositAmount + totalFeeAmount;   ------------------(1)
```

If we have to calculate the actualDepositAmout, it can be as 
```solidity
totalFeeAmount = actualDepositAmount * feeBps / BASIS_POINT_BASE;    ------------------(2) 
```

Using eq. (1) and (2), 
```solidity
input_amount =  actualDepositAmount + (actualDepositAmount * feeBps) / BASIS_POINT_BASE; 
actualDepositAmount = (inputAmount * BASIS_POINT_BASE) / (BASIS_POINT_BASE + feeBps);     -----------------(3) 
```

using eq. (3), the amount to be deposited calculated as 
```solidity
actualDepositAmount = (100e18 * 10_000) / (10_000 + 1000) = 90909090909090909090 (~90.90 ether)
```
and the fee that must charge to the user is `100 ether - 90.90 ether = 9.1 ether`(from eq. 1). However, currently in [`previewFee()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1141), its charges a total `10 ether` as a fee on `100 ether` input funds, causing users to lose an additional `0.9 ether` in fee. 

### Impact

Due to incorrect fee logic, users are charged more than they should be.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a fee structure similar to [`EthosVouch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L975-L989)
