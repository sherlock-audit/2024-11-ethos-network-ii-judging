# ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.sol should be used instead of ReentrancyGuard.sol

### Summary

In upgradeable smart contracts, maintaining a consistent storage layout is critical, as each contract upgrade relies on an unchanged storage structure to function correctly. The `ReentrancyGuard.sol` contract was developed for non-upgradeable implementations, meaning it does not follow the same storage pattern as `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.sol`, which was specifically designed to support upgradeable contracts. If `ReentrancyGuard.sol` is mistakenly used in an upgradeable context, there is a high risk of storage clashes. Such conflicts can lead to corrupted or misplaced data, as `ReentrancyGuard.sol` lacks the initializer structure needed for compatibility with upgradeable proxies, including the UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) and other proxy-based patterns. Therefore, using `ReentrancyGuard.sol` in upgradeable contracts is unsafe and could result in significant issues.
Also, the use of `ReentrancyGuard.sol` is opposite of how AccessControl is setup in the `EthosVouch.sol` contract.

> import { AccessControl } from "./utils/AccessControl.sol";

The custom access control contract, inherits from [`AccessControlEnumerableUpgradeable.sol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/utils/AccessControl.sol#L7) from OpenZeppelin which also suggests that the contracts are meant to be compliant with upgradeable pattern, and thus using non-upgradeable `ReentrancyGuard.sol` is quite the opposite of what's intended.

### Root Cause

In [EthosVouch.sol#L11](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L11), the issue is caused by the use of non-upgradeable variant of the contract instead of upgradeable ones.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Using ReentrancyGuard.sol might result in storage clashes that could corrupt data, as ReentrancyGuard.sol will not have the same initializer structure, making it incompatible with UUPS or other upgradeable proxy patterns

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

`ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable.sol` from OZ should be used instead of ReentrancyGuard.sol
