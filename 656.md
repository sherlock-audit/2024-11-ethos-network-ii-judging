# Users can deposit less than the minimum vouch amount

### Summary

There's a `configuredMinimumVouchAmount` state variable that the vouch amount to deposit should be checked against, however this check compares `configuredMinimumVouchAmount` and `msg.value` instead of `toDeposit` allowing the users to have a `toDeposit` vouch amount smaller than the minimum required `configuredMinimumVouchAmount`. Smaller amounts than expected will be staked for a vouch in wei.

### Root Cause
