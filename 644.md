# `verifiedProfileIdForAddress` May Return Valid Profile IDs Without Valid Associated Addresses

## Summary
The verifiedProfileIdForAddress function in EthosVouch and ReputationMarket retrieves valid profileIds from EthosProfile. However, the address tied to a profileId may have been removed. This discrepancy allows operations on profileIds that lack valid associated addresses, leading to unintended behavior or asset loss.
## Vulnerability Detail

EthosProfile explicitly allows profileIds to remain valid even if the associated address has been removed.
EthosVouch :
`vouchByAddress` : will call `vouchByProfileId` with a profileId whos address has been removed
`vouchByProfileId` : will be able to vouch on this profile even though an address is not present
(both the voucher and vouchee might have been removed from `EthosProfile`)
`increaseVouch` : only vouchee might not have an address.
`markUnhealthy` : only vouchee might not have an address.

May set a donation recipient tied to a removed address.
ReputationMarket :
`updateDonationRecipient` : donation recipient about to be changed would have been removed.
## Impact
Operational Risks:
    Protocol actions (e.g., vouching, market creation, or donations) could involve profileIds without valid addresses, leading to lost or stuck assets.
Reputational Risks:
    Users may lose trust in the protocol due to unreliable address-profile mappings.
## Code Snippet
- across both the above contracts
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a check in EthosVouch and ReputationMarket to confirm that the address behind a profileId exists before allowing operations.
A whole new utility will be required
