# Vouches for Mock Profiles Result in Stuck Donation Fees

### Summary

The `EthosVouch` contract allows vouchers to vouch for mock profiles. However, when a voucher does so, the donation fees are deposited as rewards for the mock profile, which lacks an associated address. As a result, the donation fees become permanently stuck.


### Root Cause

- The [EthosVouch._depositRewards()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L687-L690) function deposits rewards for any given profile ID without verifying if the profile is mocked.
```solidity
  function _depositRewards(uint256 amount, uint256 recipientProfileId) internal {
    rewards[recipientProfileId] += amount;
    emit DepositedToRewards(recipientProfileId, amount);
  }
```
For mock profiles (used for attestation), there is no actual address associated with the profile ID. Therefore, rewards deposited for such profiles cannot be accessed or withdrawn, leading to permanently stuck funds.


### Internal pre-conditions

- `entryDonationFeeBasisPoints` must be greater than zero.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A voucher vouches for a mock profile created for attestation purposes.
2. The donation fees are calculated and deposited into the rewards for the mock profile.
3. Since the mock profile lacks an associated address, the deposited donation fees become irretrievable.


### Impact

The donation fees for mock profiles are permanently stuck in the contract.
As per following [comment](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L27):
>  Subject must have a valid profile or be a mock profile created via address/attestation review

it is obviously intended to vouch for the mock profile created by attestation.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the `_depositRewards()` function to exclude mock profiles from reward deposits.
