# Market donation recipient can loose funds

### Summary

In [`ReputationMarket::updateDonationRecipient`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L544C1-L564C4) function, if `msg.sender` being current donation recipient, passes his own address as `newRecipient` then his balance in the `donationEscrow` mapping will be doubled and immediately it will be reset to `0`

### Root Cause

While transferring the donation escrow amount from the existing donation recipient to the new donation recipient it is not checked that both the addresses must not be the same.

```solidity
  function updateDonationRecipient(uint256 profileId, address newRecipient) public whenNotPaused {
    ....SNIP
@>  donationEscrow[newRecipient] += donationEscrow[msg.sender];
@>  donationEscrow[msg.sender] = 0;
    emit DonationRecipientUpdated(profileId, msg.sender, newRecipient);
  }
```
