### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The intended bahviour is not followed here. When the protocol is in paused state not deposit and withdrawals are allowed but due to this missing check the user can still deposit funds via calling `increaseVouch` function.

### PoC

1. The Admin set the protocol in paused state.
2. The author called `increaseVouch`  and deposit funds in protocol

### Mitigation

add `whenNotPaused` modifier to `increaseVouch` function.
