# Ability to Grief The Spesific SubjectId

### Summary

Low `configuredMinimumVouchAmount` will cause new vouch can't be created for honest user because the maximum vouch has been created with malicious address.


### Root Cause

As the contract says:

> @notice Represents a trust relationship between profiles backed by staked ETH, where one profile (author)
> vouches for another profile (subject). The stake amount represents the magnitude of trust, making
> credibility a function of stake value rather than number of vouchers.

It says that this vouch mechanism is purposed to represents a trust relationship with total stake value than number of vouchers. Total staked value in this case is a vital part of the mechanism. However, the total author to participate is limited to 256.

In the constructor `configuredMinimumVouchAmount` is set to 0.0001 ETH. This means that anyone could call `EthosVouch::vouchByProfileId` and create a vouch for spesific subject id with 0.0001 ETH. This means that anyone could fullfilled the max amount of participation including some malicious actor. This scenario will leads to new vouch in upcoming time unable to be created.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `EthosVouch::vouchByProfileId` has been called.
2. Malicious actor created 255 new address and called `EthosVouch::vouchByProfileId`.
3. Honest user will unable to vouch to this spesific subject id due to `vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId].length` has reached the maximum length.

### Impact

> Core Philosophy:
> Long-standing mutually beneficial relationships are the best indicators of trust

Since the trust is affected by long-standing relationships, then this grief will lead to new relationship can't be created.

New vouch in upcoming time unable to be created. This will impact badly if the protocol rely on the vouch including the amount.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Increase the `configuredMinimumVouchAmount` to bigger amount of ETH.
2. Increase the `maximumVouches`.
