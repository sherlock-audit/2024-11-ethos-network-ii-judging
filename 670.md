# Unrestricted update of donation recipient will cause locked funds for profiles with a contracts unable to receive ETH can be set as recipients.

### Summary

The missing validation in updateDonationRecipient allows setting any address, including contracts that do not accept ETH, as the recipient. This will cause locked funds for the affected profile, as withdrawDonations will revert when attempting to transfer ETH to a recipient that cannot accept payments.

But this is even a general problem about the lack of a way to withdraw native currency from a contract where it is widely used by users and can be blocked due to their mistakes.

### Root Cause

In ReputationMarket.sol:570 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L570

In ReputationMarket.sol, the updateDonationRecipient function does not validate whether the new recipient address is capable of receiving ETH. In addition, the function has a clear limitation that only the old address can assign a new recipient. Therefore, if the recipient's contract does not have the ability to call this function, the situation becomes even more severe. This allows any address, including contracts without proper fallback or receive functions, to be set as the recipient. When withdrawDonations is called for such a recipient, the _sendEth function will revert due to failed ETH transfer.

### Internal pre-conditions

1.	User calls updateDonationRecipient and sets the recipient to a contract address.
2.	The new recipient contract does not implement receive or fallback functions to accept ETH and can't call to the updateDonationRecipient.

### External pre-conditions

1.  The user calls withdrawDonations for the profile.
2. The _sendEth function fails, as the recipient contract reverts when attempting to accept ETH.

### Attack Path

1. User unintentionally sets a recipient address to a contract that cannot accept ETH.
2. Any call to withdrawDonations for the affected profile fails, as _sendEth reverts due to the recipient contractâ€™s inability to accept ETH.

### Impact

Locked funds in the contract for affected profiles. Users cannot withdraw donations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1.  Validate the recipient in updateDonationRecipient.
2.  Fallback handling in _sendEth.
3.  Allow admins to reset the donation recipient if the current one fails to accept ETH.
4.  Allow other profile addresses to withdraw tokens if necessary
