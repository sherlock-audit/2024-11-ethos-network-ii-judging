In ReputationMarket.sol , _calculateBuy() is being called and in which , fees is being calculated in previewFees().
Problem here occurs is , fees is being calculated on amount which is being passed as funds in previewFees. Now the concern is 
fees values is not being calculated , on the basis amount of votes being bought at particular scenario, but it is being taken on the hardcoded amount , even though number of votes will be same but different value is being passed

### Root Cause

  here fees which is taken by user in applyfees function, is being calculated in previewFees fucntions , and it  is based on amount which is passed. so it  is possible that amount could be more than which is need to buy the tokens which is given in expected parameter.

### Attack Path

lets consider  a scenario, where x eth is needed for to buy y amount of tokens.

now when userA has passed value, which is exact as all fees has being paid and also amount of votes is properly bought.
Elsewhere userB has passed some what more value, no of votes bought is same. and protocol will refund too. but here the amount which is being return is not as intended amount, but from this refunded values to. fees has been taken. but fees should be taken from funds used in buying votes and not extra funds 

### Impact

more fees will be taken from user, by taking fees from refunded amount too

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

fees should not be taken from amount which is being refunded.
