# Author can escape slashing by front-running it and unvouching

## Description & Impact
As soon as an author sees in the mempool that the slasher has chosen to call [slash()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L520) on his profileId, they can front-run it and call [unvouch()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L452) on all their vouches. This immediately returns all the balance to the author. The `slash()` function anyway doesn't consider archived vouches while slashing since they wouldn't have any balance:
```js
  File: ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol

   520:            function slash(
   521:              uint256 authorProfileId,
   522:              uint256 slashBasisPoints
   523:            ) external onlySlasher whenNotPaused nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
   524:              if (slashBasisPoints > MAX_SLASH_PERCENTAGE) {
   525:                revert InvalidSlashPercentage();
   526:              }
   527:          
   528:              uint256 totalSlashed;
   529:              uint256[] storage vouchIds = vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId];
   530:          
   531:              for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchIds.length; i++) {
   532:                Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];
   533:@--->           // Only slash active vouches
   534:@--->           if (!vouch.archived) {
   535:                  uint256 slashAmount = vouch.balance.mulDiv(
   536:                    slashBasisPoints,
   537:                    BASIS_POINT_SCALE,
   538:                    Math.Rounding.Floor
   539:                  );
   540:                  if (slashAmount > 0) {
   541:                    vouch.balance -= slashAmount;
   542:                    totalSlashed += slashAmount;
   543:                  }
   544:                }
   545:              }
```
This may effect the author's reputation but the immediate loss of ETH which would probably be of greater value, is avoided.

## Mitigation 
- Thr protocol could consider adding a time delay between the call to `unvouch()` and funds being returned to the author. The author should be required to call a new function to pull these funds into their address once the time period has expired.
- Then, the `slash()` logic can be modified to exclude only the vouches which are archived and have zero withdrawable funds in them. We may need to add another element in `struct Vouch` named `uint256 fundsNotYetPulledByAuthor` to track this.
