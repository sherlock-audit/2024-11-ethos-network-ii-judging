# Incorrect Price Calculation Order in Vote Selling

### Summary

In the `_calculateSell` function of the ReputationMarket contract, the vote price calculation occurs after reducing the market's vote count, resulting in sellers receiving less funds than they should. This sequence of operations causes each vote to be valued at a lower price than its actual market value at the time of sale.


### Root Cause

The incorrect ordering of operations in the sell calculation loop:

```solidity:contracts/ReputationMarket.sol
while (votesSold < amount) {
if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
}

market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1; // Votes reduced first
votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive); // Price calculated with reduced supply
fundsReceived += votePrice; // Lower price added to total
votesSold++;
}
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1003
The price calculation depends on the total number of votes:
```solidity
function _calcVotePrice(Market memory market, bool isPositive) private pure returns (uint256) {
uint256 totalVotes = market.votes[TRUST] + market.votes[DISTRUST];
return (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] * market.basePrice) / totalVotes;
}
```

 **Example Calculation:**
```solidity
// Initial state: 100 trust votes, 100 distrust votes, basePrice = 1 ETH
// Selling 10 trust votes should be worth:
// First vote: (100 * 1) / 200 = 0.5 ETH(expected)
// Current:
// First vote: (99 * 1) / 199 â‰ˆ 0.497 ETH(current scenario ) 
// Difference compounds for each vote sold
```

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User has votes to sell when price is P
2. For each vote in the selling loop:
- Vote count is decreased
- Price is calculated with reduced supply
- Lower price is added to total
3. Results in total received being less than actual market value

### Impact

- Sellers receive less ETH than they should for their votes
- The impact compounds with larger sale amounts
- Creates a systematic undervaluation of sold votes

### Mitigation


 **Correct Operation Order:**
```solidity:contracts/ReputationMarket.sol
function _calculateSell(
Market memory market,
uint256 profileId,
bool isPositive,
uint256 amount
) private view returns (...) {
// ... existing checks ...

while (votesSold < amount) {
if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
}

uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive); // Calculate price first
fundsReceived += votePrice; // Add current price
market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1; // Then reduce votes
votesSold++;
}

// ... rest of the function
}
```
