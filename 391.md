# Price Manipulation Through Minimum Market Value

### Summary

Attacker can manipulate vote prices to near-zero through repeated small buys/sells, impacting all market participants
A critical flaw in the vote price calculation mechanism allows an attacker to manipulate market prices by exploiting the minimum viable state of trust/distrust votes (1 vote). When a market reaches this state, prices can be manipulated to extreme values, causing significant profit/loss for other users.


### Root Cause

In _calculateSell(), the contract attempts to prevent selling the last vote:

However, the price calculation in _calcVotePrice becomes extremely volatile when one side's vote count gets close to 1:

### Attack Path

Attacker identifies a market with minimal activity:

```solidity
Initial state example:
Trust votes: 10
Distrust votes: 10
Base price: 0.01 ETH
```
Attacker buys large amount of trust votes to skew ratio:

```solidity 
After trust vote purchase:
Trust votes: 100
Distrust votes: 10
```
Attacker slowly sells distrust votes until minimum:

```solidity
 Near minimum state:
Trust votes: 100
Distrust votes: 2  // One more sale would revert due to minimum check
```

Due to extreme imbalance:

- Trust vote price: ~0.98 * basePrice
- Distrust vote price: ~0.02 * basePrice


Price calculation becomes extremely sensitive to small changes:

```solidity 
For distrust votes:
price = (2 * basePrice) / 102  // Extremely low
// For trust votes:
price = (100 * basePrice) / 102  // Nearly full basePrice
```

### Impact

HIGH severity:

- Price manipulation affects all market participants
- Can force unfavorable trades due to extreme price disparities
- Breaks core principle: "Credibility is based on stake value"
- Market becomes non-functional at extremes

contract ReputationMarketExploit {
    function testPriceManipulation() public {
        ReputationMarket market = new ReputationMarket();
        
        // Create market with minimum config
        market.createMarket{value: 0.02 ether}();  // 2 * DEFAULT_PRICE
        
        // Buy trust votes to create imbalance
        market.buyVotes{value: 1 ether}(
            profileId,
            true,    // trust votes
            90,      // expected votes
            500      // 5% slippage
        );
        
        // Sell distrust votes to minimum
        market.sellVotes(
            profileId,
            false,   // distrust votes
            8        // sell until 2 remain
        );
        
        // Verify extreme price disparity
        uint256 trustPrice = market.getVotePrice(profileId, true);
        uint256 distrustPrice = market.getVotePrice(profileId, false);
        
        // trustPrice will be close to basePrice
        // distrustPrice will be extremely low
        assert(distrustPrice * 40 < trustPrice); // More than 40x price difference
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Implement minimum ratio requirements:

```solidity
function _calcVotePrice(Market memory market, bool isPositive) private pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalVotes = market.votes[TRUST] + market.votes[DISTRUST];
    uint256 minRatio = 10; // Example: 10%
    
    // Ensure neither side can go below minRatio of total
    require(
        market.votes[TRUST] * 100 >= totalVotes * minRatio && 
        market.votes[DISTRUST] * 100 >= totalVotes * minRatio,
        "Vote ratio exceeds allowed imbalance"
    );
    
    return (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] * market.basePrice) / totalVotes;
}
```
