# The profile owner can manipulate their market's vote price and their reputation

### Summary

The lack of profile owner address and `msg.sender` equal check in `ReputationMarket::buyVotes` and `ReputationMarket::sellVotes` allows the Market or Profile owner to manipulate vote prices by buying and selling their own votes.

### Root Cause

The **`ReputationMarket.sol`** contract is missing a check for the profile owner address in both the [`buyVotes()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442-L493) and [`sellVotes()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L534) functions. This omission makes the vote prices in the market vulnerable to manipulation by the market owner. Although there is a check to verify if the market exists and is active, there is no check to confirm whether the sender is the owner of the profile.

This contradicts the protocol's invariant : _The vote prices fluctuate dynamically based on demand, where an increase in trust votes implies higher reputation, and an increase in distrust votes implies lower reputation._


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The profile owner must create a market with a valid `marketConfigIndex`.
2. Once the market is created, the owner can call `buyVotes()` or `sellVotes()` to manipulate their own reputation.

### Impact

This vulnerability undermines the core functionality of the protocol, which is to establish reputation through Trust and Distrust votes via the market.

import { ReputationMarket } from "../contracts/ReputationMarket.sol";

contract ReputationMarketTest is Test {

  uint256 ownerProfileId;

  function setUp() external {
    vm.startPrank(USER1);
    ethosProfile = new EthosProfile();

    (, , , ownerProfileId) = ethosProfile.profileStatusByAddress(USER1);
    reputationMarket = new ReputationMarket();
    reputationMarket.initialize(USER1, USER1, USER1, USER1, USER1);
    reputationMarket.setUserAllowedToCreateMarket(ownerProfileId, true);
    vm.deal(USER1, 1 ether);
    reputationMarket.createMarketWithConfig{ value: 1 ether }(1);
    vm.stopPrank();
  }

  function testOwnerCanBuyVotes() public {
    vm.startPrank(USER1);
    vm.deal(USER1, 10 ether);
    uint256 trustVotePriceBefore = reputationMarket.getVotePrice(ownerProfileId, true);
    (uint256 expectedVotes, , , , , , ) = reputationMarket.simulateBuy(
      ownerProfileId,
      true,
      2 ether
    );
    reputationMarket.buyVotes{ value: 2 ether }(ownerProfileId, true, expectedVotes, 10);
    uint256 trustVotePriceAfter = reputationMarket.getVotePrice(ownerProfileId, true);
    vm.expectRevert();
    //This will revert as owner can buy their own votes and can manipulate the price
    assert(trustVotePriceAfter == trustVotePriceBefore);
    vm.stopPrank();
  }
}
```
`trustVotePriceAfter` and `trustVotePriceBefore` are not equal, means the creator of the market can manipulate the vote price, thereby altering their own reputation.

### Mitigation

```solidity

error AddressNotAuthorizedToBuyOrSellVotes();

 function checkSenderAndProfileAddress(uint256 profileId) public view {
    if (_ethosProfileContract().addressBelongsToProfile(msg.sender, profileId)) {
      revert AddressNotAuthorizedToBuyOrSellVotes();
    }
  }
```
Add this check at `ReputationMarket::buyVotes` and `ReputationMarket::sellVotes`
