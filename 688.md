# Maximum Total Fees Can Exceed 10%

### Summary

The contract's `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is set to 10000 (100%) which violates the documented maximum fee limit of 10% specified in the README.

### Root Cause

The `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is set to 10000 which is equivalent to 100%. This contradicts documented constraints.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120

```solidity
uint256 public constant `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` = 10000;  // Allows up to 100%
```

While individual fee setters have validation:

```solidity
function setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints(uint256 _newEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints) external onlyAdmin {
    checkFeeExceedsMaximum(entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints, _newEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints);
    entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints = _newEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints;
}
```

The maximum limit itself is set too high.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Even with trusted admins, operational risk exists where admin could accidentally set fees too high while thinking they're within 10% limit. When setting multiple fee types (protocol, donation, pool), total fees could exceed 10% without obvious error.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Set maximum limit to match documented 10%:

```diff
- uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
+ uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000;  // 10% max, matching docs
```
