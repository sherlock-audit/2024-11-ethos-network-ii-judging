# The vouch limit is not respected in the EthosVouch contract

### Summary

The fees are applied after the check to ensure that the vouching amount is higner than the minimum. Moreover the slash function don't respect the minimum amount that should be vouch. This can lead the vouch to have a dust amount vouched which socially mean nothing.

### Root Cause

In the `EthosVouch`contract the fees are applied a send after the check with the `configuredMinimumVouchAmount` as we can see :

If a user vouch with the minimum vouch amount configured he will have a smaller value. 

Moreover the slash don't also respect the minimum vouch amount as we can see :

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The configured minimum is not respected, vouch.balance could be a dust amount which mean nothing socially breaking the purpose of the protocol.  

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Refactor the `vouchByProfileId` function

```solidity 

    (uint256 toDeposit, ) = applyFees(msg.value, true, subjectProfileId);
 if (toDeposit < configuredMinimumVouchAmount) {
      revert MinimumVouchAmount(configuredMinimumVouchAmount);
    }
```
Refactor also the slash function to slash only the vouchs that are higher than the configured minimum.
