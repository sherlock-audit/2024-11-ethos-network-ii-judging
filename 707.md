# Missing Slippage Protection in Vote Selling

### Summary

The `sellVotes` function lacks slippage protection, unlike its buying counterpart. This omission may lead to  a scenario where sellers are receiving significantly less value than expected when multiple sell orders are executed in the same block in a busy market .

### Root Cause

The `sellVotes` function does not implement slippage checks:

```solidity:contracts/ReputationMarket.sol
function sellVotes(
uint256 profileId,
bool isPositive,
uint256 amount
) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
_checkMarketExists(profileId);

// No slippage parameter or check
(uint256 votesSold, uint256 fundsReceived, ...) = _calculateSell(
markets[profileId],
profileId,
isPositive,
amount
);
// ... rest of the function
}
```

Compare this with the `buyVotes` function which has slippage protection:
```solidity:contracts/ReputationMarket.sol
function buyVotes(
uint256 profileId,
bool isPositive,
uint256 expectedVotes,
uint256 slippageBasisPoints
) public payable {
// ...
_checkSlippageLimit(votesBought, expectedVotes, slippageBasisPoints);
// ...
}
```

### Attack Path


Consider this scenario :
1. Alice  submits a transaction to sell 1000 trust votes of a market 
2. Bob also submits a transaction to sell trust 1000 votes of that market  at the same time . 
3. Bob's transaction gets executed first , reducing the price of trust votes . 
4. Alice's transaction gets executed later on a lower price point . alice recieves much smaller amount than expected . 

Here's a sample simplified calculation . 
```solidity
// Initial state: 10000 trust votes, basePrice = 1 ETH
// Initial state: 
// - 10000 trust votes
// - 10000 distrust votes (total 20000 votes)
// - basePrice = 1 ETH

// Price calculation for first vote (before Bob):
Initial price = (10000 * 1) / 20000 = 0.5 ETH

// After Bob's 1000 vote sale:
// Trust votes = 9000
// Total votes = 19000
New price = (9000 * 1) / 19000 ≈ 0.474 ETH

// Price continues to decrease as votes are sold
// For Alice's 1000 votes, prices will range from 0.474 ETH to 0.450 ETH
// (8000 * 1) / 18000 ≈ 0.450 ETH

//average price for bob = 0.487 ( expected by alice ) 
//// Average price ≈ 0.462 ETH( actual ) 
expected return = 487 eth 
Actual return for alice ≈ 1000 * 0.462 = 462 ETH
loss = 25 eth ( 5.133% loss ) //percentage will increase based on size of the order and market condition 
```
This scenario can naturally happen  in a very busy market . If two sell order are in the same block , later executed one will recieve less than expected as there is no slippage check.

### Mitigation

Add slippage protection to `sellvotes ` as ` buyVotes ` have .
