# Logic error in function increaseVouch()

### Summary

The minimum vouch amount must be greater than or equal to `ABSOLUTE_MINIMUM_VOUCH_AMOUNT`. However, the current check for the amount in the `increaseVouch` function is not suitable for the intended financial logic.

### Root Cause

When vouches are initially created, the vouch amount is verified in the function `vouchByProfileId` ([EthosVouch.sol#L380-L382](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L380C5-L382C6)):

```solidity
function vouchByProfileId(
    uint256 subjectProfileId,
    string calldata comment,
    string calldata metadata
) public payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    ...
    // must meet the minimum vouch amount
    if (msg.value < configuredMinimumVouchAmount) {
        revert MinimumVouchAmount(configuredMinimumVouchAmount);
    }
    ...
}
```

After the initial vouch, the amount staked is already greater than `ABSOLUTE_MINIMUM_VOUCH_AMOUNT`. The purpose of the `increaseVouch` function is to increase the amount staked for an existing vouch. Therefore, when this function is invoked, `msg.sender` has already staked an amount that meets the minimum vouch requirement. It is unnecessary to check the amount again using the same vouch ID in `increaseVouch`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This logic error can lead to financial issues when attempting to increase the vouch amount, resulting in unnecessary complications.

### Proof of Concept

_No response_

### Mitigation

To resolve this issue, the verification in the `increaseVouch` function should be updated as follows:

```solidity
function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable nonReentrant {
    // Check that the increase amount is not zero
    require(msg.value != 0, "invalid amount to increase");
    ...
}
```
