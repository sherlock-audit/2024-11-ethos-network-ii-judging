# Fee recipient can block all vouches/ unvouches/ slashes

### Summary
From the contest's readMe: 

> Fee receiver should not have any additional access (beyond standard users)

However, within each of `vouch`, `unvouch`, `slash`, a fee is sent to the `feeRecipient`

```solidity
  function _depositProtocolFee(uint256 amount) internal {
    (bool success, ) = protocolFeeAddress.call{ value: amount }("");
    if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Protocol fee deposit failed");
  }
```

As it is sent in the form of native eth and the return value is checked, if the `feeRecipient` makes its receive method revert, it will block all `vouch`, `unvouch`, `slash` calls. This breaks the intended invariant that the fee receiver must not have any additional access beyond what a regular user has.


### Root Cause
Fee recipient can DoS the protocol.


### Attack Path
1. Fee recipient makes its `receive` method revert
2. All `vouch`, `unvouch` and `slash` calls are DoS'd

### Impact

DoS, broken invariant


### Mitigation
Add the recipient's funds to an escrow.
