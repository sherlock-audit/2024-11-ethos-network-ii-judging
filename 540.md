# _removeFromArray may cause unintended array manipulation errors during high index values

### Summary

The `_removeFromArray `function in `EthosVouch.sol` may exhibit unexpected behavior or logical issues when index exceeds the bounds of the array, as the function assumes index is always valid. Without a proper bounds check, it could lead to silent errors or data corruption, as it defaults to removing the last element.

### Root Cause

In `EthosVouch.sol:893`, the _removeFromArray function lacks a bounds check for the index parameter, allowing invalid indices to bypass proper removal logic.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The system must attempt to remove an element with an index greater than or equal to the length of the array.
- The array involved must contain at least one element.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The system provides an invalid index parameter to _removeFromArray.
2. The function assumes the index is valid and tries to remove an element at index.
3. If the index is out of bounds, the logic inadvertently removes the last element of the array, creating unintended state changes or data loss.

### Impact

The protocol may suffer unexpected behavior or data integrity issues, including:

- Data Corruption: Unintended elements may be removed from critical arrays.
- Logic Flaws: State-dependent logic relying on precise array modifications may break

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a Bounds Check: Ensure the index is valid before proceeding:
`require(index < arr.length, "Index out of bounds");`
