# Reentrancy Attack in `ReputationMarket::withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()`

## Summary

Reentrancy attack occurs when protocol not implemented yet CEI pattern in `ReputationMarket::withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()`. Attacker could still all of funds from protocol.

## Vulnerability detail

This vulnerability comes from protocol not doing check-effect-interactions in system. Let's see code below : 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L660-L678

Native token are sent first and then state of `marketFunds[profileId]` is updated after sending the native token. It can impact reentrancy attack to the protocol.

## Impact

Attacker can still all of funds from the protocol.

## Recommendations

Implement CEI to avoid reentrancy attack

```diff
 function withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(uint256 profileId) public whenNotPaused { 
   address authorizedAddress = contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName( 
     "GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL" 
   ); 
   if (msg.sender != authorizedAddress) { 
     revert UnauthorizedWithdrawal(); 
   } 
   _checkMarketExists(profileId); 
   if (!graduatedMarkets[profileId]) { 
     revert MarketNotGraduated(); 
   } 
   if (marketFunds[profileId] == 0) { 
     revert InsufficientFunds(); 
   } 

+   marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
   _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]); 
   emit MarketFundsWithdrawn(profileId, msg.sender, marketFunds[profileId]); 
-   marketFunds[profileId] = 0; 
 } 
```
