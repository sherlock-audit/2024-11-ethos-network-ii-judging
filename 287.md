# Incorrect vote price computation in `_calculateSell`

### Summary

The `_calculateSell` function will incorrectly overwrite the first computed `votePrice`, making the sell price of the first item always be smaller than it should

### Root Cause

In [`ReputationMarket.sol`:1038](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1038), the `fundsReceived` is incremented **after** computing the new `votePrice` after decrementing `market.votes`.  This leads to an incorrect accumulation of the `fundsReceived`, leading to always selling votes at a lower rate than expected

### Internal pre-conditions

User wants to sell votes.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User wants to sell some `TRUST` or `DISTRUST` votes (doesn't matter) by triggering `sellVotes`.
2. Inside `_calculateSell`, at line [1026](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1026), the current vote price is queried.
3. At line [1036](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1036), `market.votes` is **decremented by one**, which will affect posterior calls to `_calcVotePrice`.
4. At line [1037](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1036), the vote price is calculated again **(note that the initial vote price from step 2 has not been used to increment `fundsReceived`)**.
5. After computing the decremented vote price, `fundsReceived` is actually incremented. However, the `votePrice` is smaller than it should be.



### Impact

High. Depending on the current amount of votes and the amount of votes to sell, loss could exceed 10 USD, which [is a valid high as per sherlock rules](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/audits/judging/guidelines#iv.-how-to-identify-a-high-issue).

Note that it is also possible to create different market configs. [As long as the `basePrice` is greater than `MINIMUM_BASE_PRICE`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L370), the market config can be added, which means that markets with a base price of 0,01 ETH or even 1 ETH could be created, which would increase the total lose for the user when selling.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the logic in `_calculateSell` to update the price **after** incrementing `fundsReceived`:

```diff

function _calculateSell(
    Market memory market,
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  )
    private
    view
    returns (
      uint256 votesSold,
      uint256 fundsReceived,
      uint256 newVotePrice,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    )
  {
    uint256 votesAvailable = votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST];

    if (votesAvailable < amount) {
      revert InsufficientVotesOwned(profileId, msg.sender);
    }

    uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);

    uint256 maxPrice = votePrice;
    uint256 minPrice;

    while (votesSold < amount) {
      if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
        revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
      }

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1; 
-      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive); 
      fundsReceived += votePrice;
+      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive); 
      votesSold++;
    }
```
