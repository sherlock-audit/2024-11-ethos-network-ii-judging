# Missing access control check if (authorAddress is msg.sender) in markUnhealthy function leading to compromised address attached to profileId marking that unvouch as unhealthy

### Summary

Missing access control check if (authorAddress is msg.sender) in markUnhealthy function leading to compromised address attached to profileId marking that unvouch as unhealthy even if it is not intented by author leading to impact in vouched user's score. It was in the plan and design of Ethos to include that check in `markUnhealthy` function also as its mentioned in comments to be included in accessControl [EthosVouch.sol:56](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L56) but the check is missing in function.

### Root Cause

- Missing access control check if (authorAddress is msg.sender) in [markUnhealthy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L496) function leads to compromised address attached to profileId marking it as unhealthy even though it might not be intended by author of the vouch.

### Internal pre-conditions

- It should be marked unvouched by author after that this attack can be carried out by compromised address.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- After the vouch is unvouched by authorAddress, if there is any other address which is compromised and attached to that profileId can call markUnhealthy.

### Impact

- The author of vouch would have only meant to unvouch to withdraw funds or some other reason but any other address attached to that profileId which is compromised can call markUnhealthy and remove vouch's impact on subject user's score which was not intented behaviour by vouch's author and since Ethos is social platform it impacts on its core functionality which is score.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Add check for `if (vouches[vouchId].authorAddress != msg.sender) {
      revert AddressNotVouchAuthor(vouchId, msg.sender, vouches[vouchId].authorAddress);
    }` in [markUnhealthy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L487) function also in EthosVouch file.
