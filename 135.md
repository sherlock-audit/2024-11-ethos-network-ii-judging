# Incorrect accounting of `marketFunds` in `ReputationMarket::buyVotes`

### Summary

`marketFunds` is used to track how many funds the market has raised so far, and when a market is graduated, all of its funds will be sent to the graduate contract for further distribution. However, in `buyVotes`, the accounting is incorrect, which will cause more than actual amount of funds being added to `marketFunds`, causing potential DoS and even loss of funds.

### Root Cause

In `buyVotes`, the exact amount will be paid is calculated [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L978):
```soldity
  function _calculateBuy(
    Market memory market,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 funds
  )
    private
    view
    returns (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      uint256 newVotePrice,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    )
  {
    uint256 fundsAvailable;
    (fundsAvailable, protocolFee, donation) = previewFees(funds, true);
    uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);

    uint256 minPrice = votePrice;
    uint256 maxPrice;

    if (fundsAvailable < votePrice) {
      revert InsufficientFunds();
    }

    while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
      fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
      fundsPaid += votePrice;
      votesBought++;

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    }
    fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;

    maxPrice = votePrice;

    return (votesBought, fundsPaid, votePrice, protocolFee, donation, minPrice, maxPrice);
  }
```
And as we can see near the end of function, `fundsPaid` also includes all fees derived. Later in `buyVotes`:
```solidity
    (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value);

    _checkSlippageLimit(votesBought, expectedVotes, slippageBasisPoints);

    // Apply fees first
    applyFees(protocolFee, donation, profileId);

    // Update market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += votesBought;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += votesBought;

    // Add buyer to participants if not already a participant
    if (!isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender]) {
      participants[profileId].push(msg.sender);
      isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = true;
    }

    // Calculate and refund remaining funds
    uint256 refund = msg.value - fundsPaid;
    if (refund > 0) _sendEth(refund);

    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
```

We see `fundsPaid` is used to account the market fund, which also includes fee, but this is incorrect, as protocol fees will be immediately sent to fee recipient, and donation fees can also be claimed by market fee recipient, all of those amount should not be included in the total market funds. This raises an issue, when a market is graduated and its funds are withdrawn, all the recorded amount is sent out:
```solidity
  function withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(uint256 profileId) public whenNotPaused {
    address authorizedAddress = contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(
      "GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL"
    );
    if (msg.sender != authorizedAddress) {
      revert UnauthorizedWithdrawal();
    }
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);
    if (!graduatedMarkets[profileId]) {
      revert MarketNotGraduated();
    }
    if (marketFunds[profileId] == 0) {
      revert InsufficientFunds();
    }

    _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]);
    emit MarketFundsWithdrawn(profileId, msg.sender, marketFunds[profileId]);
    marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
  }
```
But since when dealing with `buyVotes`, fees are included, this mean, it will sent out more than expected, with the contract only hold assets less than this amount. For the first few graduations, it should work fine, but the last one may not have enough fund to cover vote sellings and graduation, leaving funds to stuck in the contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

Users create market and buy/sell votes like normal. For example, Alice created a market with liquidity of 1000 wei, and Bob later buys votes for 30 wei, this 30 wei is 27 wei to market, 2 wei to protocol, and 1 wei for donation. So the actual market funds, which the contract can cover is 1027, but in record, it's 1030.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

When such market is graduated, it will fail, because it just simply doesn't have the funds to cover the transfer, leaving all market funds potentially stuck.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Don't add fees to `fundRaised` in `_calculateBuy`, just like how it's done in `_calculateSell`.
