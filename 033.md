# Incorrect calculation of funds on `buyVotes` could DoS `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds`

### Summary

Consider the [`withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L675) function. This function withdraws marketFunds eth from the contract.

However, if there is no such amount of ETH on the contract, the function will not work.
```solidity
function withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(uint256 profileId) public whenNotPaused {
    address authorizedAddress = contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(
      "GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL"
    );
    if (msg.sender != authorizedAddress) {
      revert UnauthorizedWithdrawal();
    }
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);
    if (!graduatedMarkets[profileId]) {
      revert MarketNotGraduated();
    }
    if (marketFunds[profileId] == 0) {
      revert InsufficientFunds();
    }

    _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]);
    emit MarketFundsWithdrawn(profileId, msg.sender, marketFunds[profileId]);
    marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
  }
```
Now let's look at how market funds are changing. 
1. marketFunds is [assigned](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L344) an initial value in `_createMarket`.
```solidity
marketFunds[profileId] = initialLiquidityRequired;
```
2. marketFunds is [increases](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481) when ``buyVotes`` is purchased
```solidity
marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
```
3. marketFunds [decreases](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L522 when ``sellVotes`` are sold.
```solidity
marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
```

However, in the `buyVotes` function, marketFunds does not change by the number of eths that are on the contract.
Let's look at what `fundsPaid` consists of.

As you can see from the `_calculateBuy` function - fundsPaid = priceForShares + protocolFee + donation

```solidity
while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
      fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
      fundsPaid += votePrice;
      votesBought++;

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
 }
fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;
```

However, protocolFee is immediately sent to the feeAddress, i.e., it is not stored on the contract. Donation can be instantly output in the `withdrawDonations` function

Thus, the actual amount of eth stored on the contract is less than that specified in marketFunds, so the withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds function will not work in extreme cases where there is no oversupply of ether.


### Root Cause

ETH that is not stored on the contract is recorded in marketFunds and is assumed to be ETH that is stored on the contract.

Protocol Fee, Donation in `buyVotes`  should not go into marketFunds

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Let initial liquidity be 100.
The price per 1 share is 90.
User buys 1 share and its msg.value = 100.

So 5 is protocol fee (max 5%), 5 is donation (max 5%), price = 90.

marketFunds = 200. However, the contract will only hold 190, because protocolFee and donation will be withdrawn

### Impact

- DoS of core function
- incorrect funds calculation

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

`marketFunds = fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation`

Or just don't add these variables to fundsPaid in the â€˜calculateBuy` function
