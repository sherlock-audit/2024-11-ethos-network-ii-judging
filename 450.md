# Due to missing check if authorAddress is msg.sender in claimRewards function any compromisedAddress attached to profileId can withdraw rewards funds leading to loss in funds

### Summary

Due to missing check if an authorAddress is msg.sender in claimRewards function if any address gets compromised which is attached to profileId can withdraw rewards funds. This is something that Ethos Protocol does not want to happen that compromised address can withdraw funds as they have included a check for it if authorAddress is msg.sender in [unvouch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L459) function.

### Root Cause

In [claimRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L667) function in EthosVouch.sol:667 the check is missing if authorAddress is msg.sender which leads to if any address attached to that profileId gets compromised then attacker is able to withdraw rewards and breach the motivation of protocol to not let the compromised address attached to profileId withdraw funds for which there is check in unvouch function.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- The attacker who has access to any address which is attached to particular profileId can withdraw rewards funds attached to that profileId.

### Impact

- The profileId owner suffers loss in their rewards funds if one of their address attached to profileId gets compromised which is not what Ethos protocol wants and trying to prevent from it with a check if authorAddress is msg.sender in unvouch function.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- Add the same [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L459) `vouches[vouchId].authorAddress != msg.sender) {
      revert AddressNotVouchAuthor(vouchId, msg.sender, vouches[vouchId].authorAddress);
    }`
which is present in unvouch function in [claimRewards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L667C12-L667C24) function also which prevents in any other address attached to profileId from withdrawing rewards funds even if it gets compromised.
- Instead of sending funds to msg.sender send funds to authorAddress whose logic is at EthosVouch.sol:681 this way even if compromised address calls it funds will still be sent to authorAddress.
