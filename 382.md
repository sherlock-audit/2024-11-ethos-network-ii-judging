# Max total fees can be more than 10% in `EthosVouch` contract

### Summary

The `README` states that the max total fees can't be more than 10%:

```solidity
For both contracts:
- Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%

```

But the [`MAX_TOTAL_FEES`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120) in `EthosVouch` contract is defined as 10000 that is 100%.

### Root Cause

The `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is equal to 10000 in the `EthosVouch` contract and it is defined as constant:

```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
```
It is known that 100 is 1%, so 10000 is 100% not 10% as the README states.

The `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is used in the `checkFeeExceedsMaximum` function that is executed before updating the fees and this function is used in the [`setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L566C12-L572), [`setEntryDonationFeeBasisPoints`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L581C12-L587), [`setEntryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L596C12-L602), [`setExitFeeBasisPoints`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L611C12-L615) functions. The function should check if the total fees are not more than 10% (1000):

```solidity

function checkFeeExceedsMaximum(uint256 currentFee, uint256 newFee) internal view {
    uint256 totalFees = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints +
      exitFeeBasisPoints +
      entryDonationFeeBasisPoints +
      entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints +
      newFee -
      currentFee;
@>  if (totalFees > MAX_TOTAL_FEES) revert FeesExceedMaximum(totalFees, MAX_TOTAL_FEES);
}

```

But the problem is that the function will revert when the `totalFees` are more than 10000, not when they are more than 1000.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The `EthosVouch::checkFeeExceedsMaximum` function allows the fees to be more than 10% that contradicts to the protocol's documentation. Fees are set by the admin, but the admin must set multiple fees and can very easily inadvertently bypass the 10% fee limit. Therefore in my opinion this is more than low severity issue.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change the value of `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` from 10000 to 1000.
