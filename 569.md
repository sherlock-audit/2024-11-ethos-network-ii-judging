# lack of payable in create market

### Summary

when create market is called by createMarketWithConfig

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L315

it checks if the msg.value is less than initial liquidity required 

    if (msg.value < initialLiquidityRequired) {

however the function create market is not payable this causes the transaction to revert everytime the msg.value >0

### Attack Path

### Impact

In Solidity, using "msg.value" in non-payable functions is not permitted for security reasons. "msg.value" represents the amount of ether being sent with the function call. If it is used in a non-payable function, this indicates that the function is receiving ether, which was not intended.
