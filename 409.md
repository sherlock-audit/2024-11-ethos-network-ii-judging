# Wrong value defined for EthosVouch::MAX_TOTAL_FEES allows protocol to set fees percentage up to 100% breaking 10% maximum fee value invariant

### Summary

A wrong value is defined for EthosVouch::MAX_TOTAL_FEES allowing protocol to set fees percentage up to 50% breaking 10% maximum value invariant


### Root Cause

In  EthosVouch.sol:20 , the constant variable MAX_TOTAL_FEES is wrongly defined with maximum value as 100% instead of the intended 10%  (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120 ): 
```solidity
 uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
```
This value is later used in checkFeeExceedsMaximum (EthosVouch.sol:996) function: (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L996-L1004):
```solidity
  function checkFeeExceedsMaximum(uint256 currentFee, uint256 newFee) internal view {
    uint256 totalFees = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints +
      exitFeeBasisPoints +
      entryDonationFeeBasisPoints +
      entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints +
      newFee -
      currentFee;
@>    if (totalFees > MAX_TOTAL_FEES) revert FeesExceedMaximum(totalFees, MAX_TOTAL_FEES);
  }
```
Whenever any protocol fee is changed this function checks that sum of all fees is not more than MAX_TOTAL_FEES , but because MAX_TOTAL_FEES == 10_000 = 100% then it allows that the sum of all fees be up to 100%  

### Internal pre-conditions

None, EthosVouch contract is deployed  

### External pre-conditions

Not applicable

### Attack Path

EthosVouch contract is deployed
1. Admin sets fee more at 10%, protocol allow this (and breaks invariant maximum fee of 10%) due to wrong value defined for constant value MAX_TOTAL_FEES
2. User calls EthosVouch::vouchByProfileId and his deposit is reduced by more than 10%

### Impact

Protocol's fee sum can be set up to 100%, user funds will be reduced by this percentage  

### PoC

In the following PoC:
1. Admin sets fee to 100%  
2. User calls vouchByProfileId with 0.1 ETH and its deposit is reduced by 50% (not 100% due to how fees are calculated in EthosVouch::applyFees)  
3. Invariant of max 10% overall fee is bypassed   
Save the following code in packages/contracts/test/vouch/vouch.fees.test.ts:  
```solidity
  it('Protocol fee can be more than 10% (eg 50%)', async () => {
    //const newEntryFee = 75n;
    const newEntryFee = 10_000n;

    // Set initial entry fee
    await feeConfig.entry(deployer);

    // Change entry fee
    console.log("[i] Setting newEntryFee ",newEntryFee);
    await deployer.ethosVouch.contract
      .connect(deployer.ADMIN)
      .setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints(newEntryFee);

    // Verify the new fee is applied
    const { vouchId } = await userA.vouch(userB);
    const balance = await userA.getVouchBalance(vouchId);
    console.log(
      "[i] userA.getVouchBal(vouchId)\t",
      await userA.getVouchBalance(vouchId)
    );
    const expected = calculateFee(paymentAmount, newEntryFee).deposit;
    console.log("[i] paymentAmount\t\t",paymentAmount);
    console.log("[i] depositAmount\t\t\t",expected);

    expect(balance).to.equal(expected);
  });
```
Execute test with:  
```bash
NODE_OPTIONS='--no-warnings=ExperimentalWarning --experimental-loader ts-node/esm/transpile-only' npx hardhat test test/vouch/vouch.fees.test.ts 
```
Observe in the logs that max protocol 10% fee is bypassed, and usr eth deposit value is reduced by half  
```bash
[i] userA.getVouchBal(vouchId)	 50000000000000000n
[i] paymentAmount		 100000000000000000n
[i] depositAmount			 50000000000000000n
```


### Mitigation

Modify MAX_TOTAL_FEES to:
```solidity
 uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000;
```
