# The sellVotes function does not set slippage and the user may suffer slippage losses.

### Summary

The sellVotes function does not set slippage and the user may suffer slippage losses. If there is a change in the price of the vote at sell time, it is obvious that the user will suffer a slippage loss. Slippage is checked at buyvotes but not at sell.

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L499](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L499), no parameters are passed in and a slippage check is performed.

### Internal pre-conditions
