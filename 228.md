# If new vouches are large enough and former vouch values small enough, malicious actors are incentivised to front run vouch transactions

### Summary

There is potential for large deposits to have a malicious user be incentivised to front run the transaction to unfairly claim the rewards. 

### Root Cause

See attack path.

### Attack Path

Take for example this hypothetical situation:
There currently is 10 eth vouched for a certain user. 
The fee structure is as it is in the tests:
```typescript
const entryFee = 50n;
const exitFee = 100n;
const donationFee = 150n;
const vouchIncentives = 200n;
```
(protocolFeeBasisPoints is set to be entry fee - I know this is a test, I'm just using it as a hypothetical)
```typescript
entry: async (deployer: EthosDeployer) => {
    await deployer.ethosVouch.contract
      .connect(deployer.ADMIN)
      .setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints(entryFee);
  },
```

A new person is about to vouch 10,000 eth for someone - a massive increase in the amount of eth vouched - which will also cause a similarly large donation to be made to previous vouchers of 1% = 100 eth. Upon seeing this, a malicious user front runs this by [calling the vouch function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L309) with 1000 eth. 

This malicious user pays the cumulative fees of 2.5%, so they have 975 eth vouched. They then will receive the majority of the 1.5% donation fee the whale voucher pays: 10000 * 0.015 * 975 / (975 + 100) = 136 eth. 
In this calculation 975 / (975 + 100) is the amount of the donation fee that the malicious user receives as donation % received is proportional to amount vouched. 
Then this malicious user can instantly claim their rewards and then unvouch, unfairly gaining excess rewards. 

### Impact

Legitimate that have vouched for a long time users lose rewards that they should have been rewarded. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Maybe add a requirement that a user has to meet a minimum time requirement to be eligible for donation rewards to prevent this poor incentive structure existing.
