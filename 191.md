# Incorrect Fee Calculation Causes Excessive Fee Overpayment

### Summary

The `EthosVouch.applyFees()` function incorrectly calculates fees, leading to vouchers overpaying fees. This miscalculation inflates the total fees, causing an unintended loss of funds for users.


### Root Cause

- The issue lies in the way [EthosVouch.applyFees()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L929-L965) calculates each fee component (`protocolFee`, `donationFee`, and `vouchersPoolFee`) using the `calcFee()` function.
```solidity
936:  uint256 protocolFee = calcFee(amount, entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints);
      uint256 donationFee = calcFee(amount, entryDonationFeeBasisPoints);
      uint256 vouchersPoolFee = calcFee(amount, entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints);
```
For instance, at line `936`, the `calcFee()` assumes that `toDeposit = amount - protocolFee`:
```solidity
  function calcFee(uint256 total, uint256 feeBasisPoints) internal pure returns (uint256 fee) {
    /*
     ------ SKIP ------
     * 6. fee = total - deposit
     * 7. fee = total - (total * 10000 / (10000 + feeBasisPoints))
     */
    return
      total -
      (total.mulDiv(BASIS_POINT_SCALE, (BASIS_POINT_SCALE + feeBasisPoints), Math.Rounding.Floor));
  }
```
However, at line `952`, in fact, `toDeposit = amount - totalFees`:
```solidity
      totalFees = protocolFee + donationFee + vouchersPoolFee;
952:  toDeposit = amount - totalFees;
```


### Internal pre-conditions

At least two of the following values must be greater than zero:
- `entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints`
- `entryDonationFeeBasisPoints`
- `entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints`


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Set `entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints = 5000` (`50%`), `entryDonationFeeBasisPoints = 5000` (`50%`) and `entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints = 0`.
2. A voucher attempts to vouch `amount = 30000`.
3. Fees are calculated as:
    - `protocolFee = 30000 * 5000 / 15000 = 10000` 
    - `donationFee = 30000 * 5000 / 15000 = 10000`.
4. The total fees become `totalFees = 10000 + 10000 + 0 = 20000`, leaving `toDeposit = 30000 - 20000 = 10000`.

This results in `protocolFee` and `donationFee` each being `100%` (> `50%`) of the reduced `toDeposit`, overcharging fees.


### Impact

Overcharging fees leads to a significant loss of funds for users. 
Since the inflation rate of fees can be very high, this bug has a High severity.

### Mitigation

Fix the fee calculation logic to ensure fees are calculated correctly.
