# Market funds cannot be withdrawn because of incorrect calculation of `fundsPaid`

### Summary
Funds withdrawal is blocked as fees are not deducted from fundsPaid when already being applied.

## Root Cause

When votes are bought in `ReputationMarket` market, user has to pay fees to:
- donation fees going to owner of the market
- protocol fees going to treasury

This is seen in `applyFees` function below:

```solidity
  function applyFees(
    uint256 protocolFee,
    uint256 donation,
    uint256 marketOwnerProfileId
  ) private returns (uint256 fees) {
@>    donationEscrow[donationRecipient[marketOwnerProfileId]] += donation; // donation fees are updated for market owner
    if (protocolFee > 0) {
@>      (bool success, ) = protocolFeeAddress.call{ value: protocolFee }(""); // protocolFees paid to treasury
      if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Protocol fee deposit failed");
    }
    fees = protocolFee + donation;
  }
```

Next, the total amount a user pays when votes are bought is managed by the `fundsPaid` variable. The amount consists of:
`cost of votes + protocol fees + donation fees`

The vulnerability exists in the execution here:
1. send protocol fees to the treasury
2. add donations to market owner's escrow
3. marketOwner is able to withdraw donations via `withdrawDonations()`

In the `buyVotes` function, protocolFee and donation are paid first as seen below:

```solidity
 applyFees(protocolFee, donation, profileId);
```

Then, when tallying the market funds, `marketFunds` is updated with `fundsPaid`. This `fundsPaid` still includes the protocolFee and donation and has not been deducted.

```solidity
 marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid; 
```

Hence, the protocolFee and donation has been counted twice.

When a market graduates, because of the incorrect counting of `marketFunds`, the contract may not have enough funds to be withdrawn via `ReputationMarket.withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` and results in transaction reverting.


## Proof of Concept

Assume this scenario:

A market exists with 2 trust votes and 2 distrust votes, each costing 0.03 ETH. Protocol and donation fees are both set at 5%.
Alice buys 2 trust votes for 0.07 ETH:

Fees (5% each):
Protocol: 0.0015 ETH per vote → 0.003 ETH total.
Donations: 0.0015 ETH per vote → 0.003 ETH total.
Vote Cost: 0.03 ETH × 2 = 0.06 ETH.
Refund: 0.07 ETH - (0.06 ETH + 0.006 ETH fees) = 0.004 ETH.
The contract incorrectly records 0.066 ETH (votes + fees) as market funds.

Market owner withdraws the 0.06 ETH correctly available.

After market graduation, the contract attempts to withdraw the recorded 0.066 ETH, but only 0.06 ETH exists.

## Impact:

The withdrawal fails due to insufficient funds.
Funds are stuck, or other markets' funds are misallocated.
If a withdrawal succeeds, it might wrongly pull ETH allocated to other markets, leading to losses for other users.

## Recommendations

Update logic to deduct protocol fees and donations before updating `marketFunds`.
