# `slash` function lacks 24-hour lock mechanism for accused staking and withdrawals

### Summary

The `slash` function in the `EthosVouch` contract implements the slashing of the accused voucher’s stake, transferring the slashed amount to the `protocolFeeAddress`. However, according to the [Ethos Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.ethos.network/ethos-mechanisms/slash#slashing), slashing should also trigger a **24-hour lock** on staking and withdrawals for the accused. This lock mechanism is missing, allowing the accused to continue staking or withdrawing funds immediately after being slashed.


### Root Cause

The `slash` function does not implement any mechanism to enforce a **24-hour lock** on staking and withdrawals for the accused. The function only reduces the stake of the accused and transfers the slashed amount to the `protocolFeeAddress`.

Relevant Code in `slash`:

### Attack Path

1. Execute the `slash` function on an accused voucher.
2. Observe that there is no restriction on staking or withdrawing funds for the accused within the 24-hour period after slashing.
Voucher can `vouch` or `unvouch` immediately.

### Impact

The absence of the 24-hour lock mechanism deviates from the whitepaper’s described protocol, potentially enabling undesirable behavior:
1. **Evading Consequences**: The accused can withdraw remaining funds immediately after slashing, circumventing the intended lock period.
2. **Security Risk**: Lack of a cooldown period undermines the whitepaper’s design to prevent rash staking/withdrawal activity during the investigation period.

This can reduce the protocol's reliability and create vulnerabilities for malicious actors to exploit.

### Mitigation

1. **Add a Lock Data Structure**
   Add a mapping to track the lock expiration time for each profile:
   ```solidity
   mapping(uint256 => uint256) public lockExpiration; // Maps profileId to lock expiration timestamp
   ```

2. **Modify `slash` Function**
   Update the `slash` function to set the lock expiration:
   ```solidity
   lockExpiration[authorProfileId] = block.timestamp + 24 hours;

   emit LockTriggered(authorProfileId, lockExpiration[authorProfileId]);
   ```

3. **Enforce Lock in Critical Functions**
   Add a modifier to enforce the lock in staking and withdrawal functions:
   ```solidity
   modifier notLocked(uint256 profileId) {
       if (block.timestamp < lockExpiration[profileId]) {
           revert ProfileLocked(profileId, lockExpiration[profileId]);
       }
       _;
   }
   ```

`vouchByProfileId`, `increaseVouch`, `unvouch` functions can use this modifier.
