# `Withdrawal` and `unvouch` is `not possible` when the contract is `paused`

### Summary

It is not possible to  `unvouch` and `Withdraw` funds when the contract is `paused`, which violates [Ethos Network's Promise from Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.ethos.network/ethos-mechanisms/vouch#unvouch)

### Impact

User should `unvouch` and `withdraw` their funds `at any time`.
The Ethos Network Whitepaper said that clearly: [Whitepaper-> vouch#unvouch](https://whitepaper.ethos.network/ethos-mechanisms/vouch#unvouch)

```solidity
Unvouch
You may withdraw your staked funds at any time by unvouching.  <@

You cannot modify the amount staked in a vouch without withdrawing the entire vouch. 

If you are mutually vouched (3,3) and unvouch, the person who was vouched can mark a vouch as "unhealthy" within 24 hours to signal to the network the vouch ended on poor terms.
```

So when the contract is paused user can not call `unvouch` which completely violates Ethos Network's promise from the whitepaper.

### PoC

On [EthosVouch::unvouch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L452) we can see it has `whenNotPaused` modifier.
This means it can not be called when the contract is `paused`

```solidity
/**
   * @dev Unvouches vouch.
   * @param vouchId Vouch Id.
   */
  function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
    _vouchShouldExist(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);
    // because it's $$$, you can only withdraw/unvouch to the same address you used to vouch
    // however, we don't care about the status of the address's profile; funds are always attached
    // to an address, not a profile
    if (vouches[vouchId].authorAddress != msg.sender) {
      revert AddressNotVouchAuthor(vouchId, msg.sender, vouches[vouchId].authorAddress);
    }

    v.archived = true;
    // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
    v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt = block.timestamp;
    // remove the vouch from the tracking arrays and index mappings
    _removeVouchFromArrays(v);

    // apply fees and determine how much is left to send back to the author
    (uint256 toWithdraw, ) = applyFees(v.balance, false, v.subjectProfileId);
    // set the balance to 0 and save back to storage
    v.balance = 0;
    // send the funds to the author
    // note: it sends it to the same address that vouched; not the one that called unvouch
    (bool success, ) = payable(v.authorAddress).call{ value: toWithdraw }("");
    if (!success) {
      revert FeeTransferFailed("Failed to send ETH to author");
    }

    emit Unvouched(v.vouchId, v.authorProfileId, v.subjectProfileId);
  }
```

`whenNotPaused` modifier from [openzeppelin source code](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/utils/PausableUpgradeable.sol#L65C1-L75C6)

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Modifier to make a function callable only when the contract is not paused.
     *
     * Requirements:
     *
     * - The contract must not be paused.
     */
    modifier whenNotPaused() {
        _requireNotPaused();
        _;
    }
```

### Mitigation

Remove `whenNotPaused` modifier

```diff
/**
   * @dev Unvouches vouch.
   * @param vouchId Vouch Id.
   */
-  function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
+  function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public nonReentrant {
    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
    _vouchShouldExist(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);
    // because it's $$$, you can only withdraw/unvouch to the same address you used to vouch
    // however, we don't care about the status of the address's profile; funds are always attached
    // to an address, not a profile
    if (vouches[vouchId].authorAddress != msg.sender) {
      revert AddressNotVouchAuthor(vouchId, msg.sender, vouches[vouchId].authorAddress);
    }

    v.archived = true;
    // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
    v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt = block.timestamp;
    // remove the vouch from the tracking arrays and index mappings
    _removeVouchFromArrays(v);

    // apply fees and determine how much is left to send back to the author
    (uint256 toWithdraw, ) = applyFees(v.balance, false, v.subjectProfileId);
    // set the balance to 0 and save back to storage
    v.balance = 0;
    // send the funds to the author
    // note: it sends it to the same address that vouched; not the one that called unvouch
    (bool success, ) = payable(v.authorAddress).call{ value: toWithdraw }("");
    if (!success) {
      revert FeeTransferFailed("Failed to send ETH to author");
    }

    emit Unvouched(v.vouchId, v.authorProfileId, v.subjectProfileId);
  }
```

#### * Also [EthosVouch::markUnhealthy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L496) and [EthosVouch::unvouchUnhealthy](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L487) should not have `whenNotPaused` modifier which could cause different kinds of problem that I describe on my another report.
