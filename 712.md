# Insufficient Caller verification in EthosVouch::claimRewards() Allows Unauthorized Reward Claims by Compromised or deleted Addresses

### Summary

_No response_

### Root Cause

The claimRewards function in the EthosVouch contract is intended to allow users to claim rewards associated with their profile.

```solidity

  function claimRewards() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    (bool verified, , bool mock, uint256 callerProfileId) = IEthosProfile(
      contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
    ).profileStatusByAddress(msg.sender);//@check - does not check for compromised address

    // Only check that this is a real profile (not mock) and was verified at some point
    if (!verified || mock) {
      revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(msg.sender);
    }

    uint256 amount = rewards[callerProfileId];
    if (amount == 0) revert InsufficientRewardsBalance();

    rewards[callerProfileId] = 0;
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: amount }("");
    if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Rewards claim failed");

    emit WithdrawnFromRewards(callerProfileId, amount);
  }
```

However here , the function currently relies on the profileStatusByAddress method from the EthosProfile contract to validate the caller.

```solidity
/**
   * @dev Returns the status of a profile by its associated address.
   * @notice This does not check if the address has been removed from the profile.
   * It will return the profileId even if the address has been removed.
   * @param addressStr The address to check.
   * @return verified Whether the profile is verified.
   * @return archived Whether the profile is archived.
   * @return mock Whether the profile is a mock profile.
   * @return profileId The ID of the profile associated with the address.
   */
  function profileStatusByAddress(
    address addressStr
  ) public view returns (bool verified, bool archived, bool mock, uint256 profileId) {
    profileId = profileIdByAddress[addressStr];
    (verified, archived, mock) = profileStatusById(profileId);
  }
```
as mentioned in the comments this function does not check if the address has been removed from the profile, It will return the profileId even if the address has been removed. 
```solidity
 function claimRewards() external whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
 ...............
 ..............
 // Only check that this is a real profile (not mock) and was verified at some point
    if (!verified || mock) {
      revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(msg.sender);
    }
```

now in claimrewards() function it checks if the profile is verified and not a mock but does not verify if the address is compromised or has been removed from the profile

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path


- **Compromised Address**: An address associated with a profile is compromised and it has been removed in the ehtosProfile.
- **Attempt to Claim Rewards**: The compromised address calls the claimRewards function.
- **Insufficient Validation**: The function checks if the profile is verified and not a mock but does not check if the address is compromised.
- **Rewards Claimed**: The compromised address successfully claims the rewards, potentially leading to unauthorized access to funds.

### Impact

compromised address claims all the rewards

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

verify the caller is not a compromised or removed address
