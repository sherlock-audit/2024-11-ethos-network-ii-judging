# Inconsistency when handling profile vouch balance can lead to fund loss in edge case

### Summary

When a vouch is created, both author profile ID and author address is attached to the struct. The contract also allows any addresses within a profile to increase vouch. While not a source of truth, in the comments the devs have mentioned assets for vouching is tied to addresses instead of profile. But when two different addresses in the same profile increase vouch, one address can take all, and another one will take nothing. In the case of address compromise, it can cause more loss of funds.

### Root Cause

In [`increaseVouch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426C1-L444C4) we see as long as `msg.sender` is from the same profile, such address can deposit more into the same vouch:
```solidity
  function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable nonReentrant {
    // vouch increases much also meet the minimum vouch amount
    if (msg.value < configuredMinimumVouchAmount) {
      revert MinimumVouchAmount(configuredMinimumVouchAmount);
    }
    // get the profile id of the author
    uint256 profileId = IEthosProfile(
      contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
    ).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);
    _vouchShouldBelongToAuthor(vouchId, profileId);
    // make sure this vouch is active; not unvouched
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);

    uint256 subjectProfileId = vouches[vouchId].subjectProfileId;
    (uint256 toDeposit, ) = applyFees(msg.value, true, subjectProfileId);
    vouches[vouchId].balance += toDeposit;

    emit VouchIncreased(vouchId, profileId, subjectProfileId, msg.value);
  }
```

However, when `unvouch`:
```solidity
  function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
    _vouchShouldExist(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);
    // because it's $$$, you can only withdraw/unvouch to the same address you used to vouch
    // however, we don't care about the status of the address's profile; funds are always attached
    // to an address, not a profile
    if (vouches[vouchId].authorAddress != msg.sender) {
      revert AddressNotVouchAuthor(vouchId, msg.sender, vouches[vouchId].authorAddress);
    }

    v.archived = true;
    // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
    v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt = block.timestamp;
    // remove the vouch from the tracking arrays and index mappings
    _removeVouchFromArrays(v);

    // apply fees and determine how much is left to send back to the author
    (uint256 toWithdraw, ) = applyFees(v.balance, false, v.subjectProfileId);
    // set the balance to 0 and save back to storage
    v.balance = 0;
    // send the funds to the author
    // note: it sends it to the same address that vouched; not the one that called unvouch
    (bool success, ) = payable(v.authorAddress).call{ value: toWithdraw }("");
    if (!success) {
      revert FeeTransferFailed("Failed to send ETH to author");
    }

    emit Unvouched(v.vouchId, v.authorProfileId, v.subjectProfileId);
  }
```

Even though comments say assets are tied to address, not profile, but only `vouch.authorAddress` can unvouch. This would raise an issue when two or more addresses have deposited in the same vouch, and in the end, no matter how much other addresses have deposited, only the author address can get all the amount. This is especially concerning when the author address is compromised, and there can be more to lose for users.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Alice holds 3 addresses in her profile, which is 0xA, 0xB, and 0xC.
2. Alice vouched to Bob's profile with 0xA initially with 1 ETH, making this address the author address
3. Alice later used 0xB address to increase her vouch to Bob with another 2 ETH

### External pre-conditions

1. Alice's main address, 0xA is compromised, Alice acted quick and removed this address from her profile, and accepts the fate of losing the initial 1 ETH deposit.
2. Alice later wants to unvouch, to get her 2 ETH back for the deposit made with 0xB, but she could not, because only 0xA can unvouch as it's the author address.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The impact is for an user to lose additional funds in the edge presented above, if one address is compromised, the loss of all its assets can be expected, but it shouldn't be the case for assets originally holds by other address.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

There are two issues here, one is in case of emergency, there is no way of rescuing assets in vouch, as assets are related to per address. The second one is despite it says assets are related to address, multi-address scenario would cause loss of funds. The mitigation suggestion for the latter issue is to track vouch and its depositors separately, or to make it simple, only allow author address to increase vouch.
