# User can reenter the BuyVote function and grief the market funds to be withdrawed!!

### Summary

In BuyVotes() in reputation.sol, remaining eth is being send to user first , and then markerFunds[profileId] is being accounted.
User could create a attack vector where, number of funds which should be accounted would be less, than it actual should be.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L476C3-L481C41

here it is being accounted after sendeth function is called.

### Attack Path

Lets Consider a scenario,

User wants to, buy 10 votes from market.

now what he will do is, he call buyVote() with amount of 1 vote.

So here , it situation would occur is he will give fee for 1 vote, and 1 vote will bought , now when sendEth would be called,
what user will do , again reenter function with same 1 token amount. 

like this he will do 10 times., and at last 

marketFunds[profileID] would get ++ with only fundsPaid for 1 amount of votes.

So here actual user will end up on giving total amount for 10 votes , and also actuall fee would also be given in applyFees fucntion

but the amount that should be incremented in market funds , would not be actual and it would be of only 1 tokens instead of 10.
this could grief graduator when he withdraw, very less amount would be there. And funds will be there in contract only.

### Impact

less amout of market funds would be accounted, and attacker will greif trusted user from being withdraw actual amount which he should and attacker will leave that funds in contract. So it is loss of funds for protocol as he will not be able to withdraw

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

market funds should be accounted before send eth is called!!
