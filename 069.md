# User can vouch on archived subject contrary to documentation

### Summary

The missing check in `increaseVouch()` allows to vouch on archived subjectId.

### Root Cause

In [increaseVouch()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426-L444) there is missing check that subjectProfileId is not archived.

As a result user can vouch for archived subject [contrary to documentation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L32)

### Internal pre-conditions

Author must submit vouch when subject is not archived. And only then he is available to increase balance.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls `vouchByProfileId()` with minimum amount
2. Subject is archived
3. User calls `increaseVouch()`, increasing his stake on archived subject

### Impact

Documentation is violated. Description in the file beginning serves as documentation.

User can increase stake balance on archived subject. It is hard to point out exact impact because system is not fully implemented yet.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add missing check.
