# Inconsistent Fee Calculation Leads to pay user more then intended !

### Summary

The `calcFee` function in the EthosVouch contract calculates fees in a manner that results in higher-than-expected deductions from the vouch amount. This discrepancy arises from the formula used to calculate fees, which does not align with the expected behavior of deducting a fixed percentage from the total amount sent.


### Root Cause

The `calcFee` function uses the following formula to calculate fees:

```solidity:contracts/EthosVouch.sol
function calcFee(uint256 total, uint256 feeBasisPoints) internal pure returns (uint256 fee) {
/*
* Formula derivation:
* 1. total = deposit + fee
* 2. fee = deposit * (feeBasisPoints/10000)
* 3. total = deposit + deposit * (feeBasisPoints/10000)
* 4. total = deposit * (1 + feeBasisPoints/10000)
* 5. deposit = total / (1 + feeBasisPoints/10000)
* 6. fee = total - deposit
* 7. fee = total - (total * 10000 / (10000 + feeBasisPoints))
*/
return total - (total.mulDiv(BASIS_POINT_SCALE, (BASIS_POINT_SCALE + feeBasisPoints), Math.Rounding.Floor));
}
```

This formula calculates the fee based on the total amount, leading to a higher effective fee percentage than intended.
The ` deposit ` here is after deducting all the fees . but as all the fees are calculated separately , the `deposit `calcualated in this formula is actually larger then the actual deposit .

Example Scenario :
1. user wants to increase a vouch to 100 token ( lets assume all fees are at 5% in `applyfees()`  . user calculates 15% of deposit = 15 tokens . So , he deposits 115 tokens in total to increase the vouch balance by 100 token . 
2. In `applyFees` function , in each `calcFee` call , returned value is 5.47619 tokens . So , total fee is 16.42857 tokens. 
3. This increases the vouch balance by approximately 98.571428 tokens not 100 . 

- **Expected Behavior**: If a user wants to increase a vouch 115 tokens with a total fee of 15% (5% each for three fees(assumed for simplicity)), the vouch balance should be 100 tokens.
- **Actual Behavior**: The formula calculates each fee as approximately 5.47619 tokens, resulting in a total fee of approximately 16.42857 tokens.

### Impact
- Users receive less vouch balance than expected
- Potential financial loss for users due to higher-than-expected fees

### Mitigation
while calculating , all of the fees should be calculated together first with one single call to `calcFee`  , then they should be separated and sent to desired addresses . 
Otherwise , devs should re-think the current formula .
