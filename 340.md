# `ReputationMarket::updateDonationRecipient` Lack respect for EthosProfile address that marked as compromised, leading the donation fund stuck for the specific `profileId`

### Summary

EthosProfile `profileId` can have multiple addresses. Given the design where `ReputationMarket::createMarket` would create a market and assign the recipient of donation with corresponding `msg.sender` and `profileId`, there is no way to other addresses belong to `profileId` to change this address later if the current `msg.sender` are removed and marked as compromised by the owner of `profileId`.

### Root Cause

`ReputationMarket::updateDonationRecipient` has no handling if the donation recipient is already marked as compromised in EthosProfile contract, as this protocol needs EthosProfile for checking the `profileId` but `ReputationMarket` contracts lack respect of the state of EthosProfile as whole.

The [strict requirement](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L552) in `ReputationMarket` where the one who can change the address is the current recipient would be problematic later on because we should note that the design of EthosProfile `profileId` can have multiple addresses tied to it.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Alice create EthosProfile using `addressA` and got `profileId` = `1`
2. Alice also add `addressB` to her `profileId`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice call `ReputationMarket::createMarket` using `addressA`
2. the tx would set `donationRecipient` of profileId 1 = `addressA`
3. buy and sell happened
4. fast forward, Alice removed and marked as compromise for `addressA` on EthosProfile. (meaning she can't use `addressA` again)
5. now she cant call `withdrawDonations` or `updateDonationRecipient` for `profileId` = `1` and the fund for her `profileId` locked out because `addressB` can do nothing accessing the market of `profileId` tied to it.


### Impact

Because the `profileId` are tied to only one address in `ReputationMarket`, the following impact would happen if the attack path happens:

1. User can not withdraw donation corresponding of their own `profileId`. Their fund are locked in the contract.
2. The only option for user to use the `ReputationMarket` again is to abandond their `profileId` and create new one.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. function `ReputationMarket::updateDonationRecipient` and `ReputationMarket::withdrawDonations` should also check if the address registered are marked as compromise or not in the EthosProfile contracts before executing the function. This can be achieved by reading the [state of EthosProfile mapping of compromised address](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosProfile.sol#L72).
2. specifically, `updateDonationRecipient` should allow other address that belong to same `profileId` to change the donation recipient address if the current one are marked as compromised.
