# The `ReputationMarket::_calculateSell` function returns wrong value for `minVotePrice`

## Impact
### Summary 
The `ReputationMarket::_calculateSell` function is designed to calculate the amount of ether a seller will receive given the amount of votes the seller intends to sell. The function also returns some variables which are then used by the `ReputationMarket::sellVotes` function to emit events.
Unfortunately, the `ReputationMarket::_calculateSell` function returns a wrong value for `minVotePrice` resulting in the `ReputationMarket::sellVotes` function using a wrong value to emit event.

### Vulnerability Details
Based on the natspec, the `maxVotePrice` is the maximum price during transaction; `minVotePrice` is the minimum price during transaction; and `newVotePrice` is the final price per vote after sale.

The vulnerability lies in the fact that the `ReputationMarket::_calculateSell` function returns the same value for `minVotePrice` and `newVotePrice` when in fact, their values should be different.

This vulnerability can be seen by checking this link https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1003-L1045 or by taking a look at the code snippet below. 

```javascript
   function _calculateSell(
    Market memory market,
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  )
    private
    view
    returns (
      uint256 votesSold,
      uint256 fundsReceived,
      uint256 newVotePrice,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    )
  {
    uint256 votesAvailable = votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST];


    if (votesAvailable < amount) {
      revert InsufficientVotesOwned(profileId, msg.sender);
    }


    uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);


    uint256 maxPrice = votePrice;
    uint256 minPrice;


    while (votesSold < amount) {
      if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
        revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
      }


      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
      fundsReceived += votePrice;
      votesSold++;
    }
    (fundsReceived, protocolFee, ) = previewFees(fundsReceived, false);
    minPrice = votePrice; // @audit-comment note that same value is returned as minPrice and votePrice


    return (votesSold, fundsReceived, votePrice, protocolFee, minPrice, maxPrice);
  } 

```


### Impact
Since the return values of the `ReputationMarket::_calculateSell` function are used by the `ReputationMarket::sellVotes` function to emit events, returning wrong values will result in emiting wrong values in events which can mislead other oracles that depend on these events.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps

Consider modifying the `ReputationMarket::_calculateSell` to set the value of `minPrice` correctly so as to differentiate it from `votePrice` as illustrated below

```diff
function _calculateSell(
    Market memory market,
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  )
    private
    view
    returns (
      uint256 votesSold,
      uint256 fundsReceived,
      uint256 newVotePrice,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    )
  {
    uint256 votesAvailable = votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST];


    if (votesAvailable < amount) {
      revert InsufficientVotesOwned(profileId, msg.sender);
    }


    uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);


    uint256 maxPrice = votePrice;
    uint256 minPrice;


    while (votesSold < amount) {
      if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
        revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
      }


      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
-     votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
      fundsReceived += votePrice;
      votesSold++;
+     minPrice = votePrice;
+     votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    }
    (fundsReceived, protocolFee, ) = previewFees(fundsReceived, false);
-   minPrice = votePrice;


    return (votesSold, fundsReceived, votePrice, protocolFee, minPrice, maxPrice);
  }
```
