# Max fees check is `100%` not `10%` in `EthosVouch`

### Summary

The restriction for fees is `100%` not `10%` as the invariant is intended to be


### Root Cause

`EthosVouch.MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is set to `10_000`, i.e `100%` which will make changing fees by admin accpets setting total Fees to be more than `10%`, which should not occuar.

[EthosVouch.sol#L120](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120) | [EthosVouch.sol#L996-L1004](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L996-L1004)
```solidity
  uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
  uint256 public constant BASIS_POINT_SCALE = 10000;
  ...
  function checkFeeExceedsMaximum(uint256 currentFee, uint256 newFee) internal view {
    uint256 totalFees = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints +
      exitFeeBasisPoints +
      entryDonationFeeBasisPoints +
      entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints +
      newFee -
      currentFee;
>>  if (totalFees > MAX_TOTAL_FEES) revert FeesExceedMaximum(totalFees, MAX_TOTAL_FEES);
  }
```

As stated in README:

> Q: Are there any limitations on values set by admins (or other roles) in the codebase?
> 
> For both contracts:
> - Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%

The README states that the admin is restricted to set fees greater than `10%` but as `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` equals `BASIS_POINT_SCALE` it will allow admin to set all fees up to `100%`, which should not occur.
