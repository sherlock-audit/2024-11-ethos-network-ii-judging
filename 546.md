# Certain Ethos Profiles will not be albe to claim rewards.

### Summary

In EthosVouch contract valid profiles can vouch for another profiles if they meet certain criterias.

```javascript
    // you may not vouch for archived profiles
    // however, you may vouch for verified AND mock profiles
    // we allow vouching for mock profiles in case they are later verified
    if (archived || (!mock && !verified)) {
        revert InvalidEthosProfileForVouch(subjectProfileId);
    }
```

The profile that the users can vouch for has to: be non archived, can be mock if they are later verified or be verified.

The issue is that the mock profiles that the users can vouch for can't claim their rewards.

### Root Cause

We can see that users can vouch for mock profiles:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L361-L366

In `claimRewards` function there is a check that prevents mock profiles from claiming rewards. We can also see the comment:

`// Only check that this is a real profile (not mock) and was verified at some point`

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User has to have valid mock Ethos Profile.
2. User must have rewards greater than 0.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

User can't claim rewards which leads to loss of funds.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Modify the code so that mock profiles can claim earned rewards.
