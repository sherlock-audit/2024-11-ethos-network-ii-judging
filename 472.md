# `buyVotes` transaction can go out of gas

### Summary

- In `buyVotes` function, user provide eth amount in msg.value and `_calculateBuy` will count how much votes user can buy with this amount of eth where vote price is changed with every buy.
- When there is a Premium tier market config, the initial votes are 10000 both the side means the total votes are 20000 at start. With each buy and sell, the vote price changes but due to big amount of total price, the price fluctuation is very low compare to other market config.
- In such market, over a period of time when price moves one side, the other side price will be very less. And when a user will come to buy big amount of votes of lower price, the transaction will be ran out of gas due to so many iteration of while loop and user will not able to buy votes.

```solidity
while (fundsAvailable >= votePrice) {
      fundsAvailable -= votePrice;
      fundsPaid += votePrice;
      votesBought++;

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
    }
   ```
