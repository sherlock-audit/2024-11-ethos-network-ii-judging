# Griefing attack vulnerability due to unbounded loop in `ReputationMarket::sellVotes` that could result in denial-of-service for users

### Summary

The current implementation in `sellVotes` and by extention `_calculateSell` allow a potential griefing attack through the vote selling mechanism, specifically by passing a large amount of votes to sell in a single transaction.

### Root Cause

- The while loop in [ReputationMarket.sol:1003](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1003-L1045) has no upper bound on iterations.
- Each iteration performs multiple state modifications and price calculations.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

An attacker or even a normal user with sufficient funds could:
- Pass an extremely large number of votes to sell
- Cause excessive gas consumption
- Potentially hit block gas limits
- Make the transaction economically impractical

### Impact

1. Potential denial of service through gas exhaustion.
2. Increased transaction costs.
3. Possible prevention of legitimate large-scale vote selling.

### PoC

```typescript
it('Attempt to Sell 1500 Votes for Griefing Test', async () => {
    // Buy enough votes to sell
    const buyAmount = ethers.parseEther('15');  // Buy more votes
    await userA.buyVotes({ buyAmount });
  
    // Get initial vote count
    const { trustVotes: positiveBefore } = await userA.getVotes();
  
    // Attempt to sell a large number of votes in one transaction
    const sellAmount = 1500;                                 // Starts to timeout from 1000
    for (let i = 0; i < sellAmount; i++) {
      await userA.sellOneVote();
    }
  
    // Get vote count after selling
    const { trustVotes: positiveAfter } = await userA.getVotes();
    
    // Verify votes reduced
    expect(positiveAfter).to.be.lessThan(positiveBefore);
  });
```

### Mitigation

Implement a hard cap on votes per transaction

```solidity
uint256 constant MAX_VOTES_PER_TRANSACTION = 500; // Example limit

function sellVotes(...) {
    require(amount <= MAX_VOTES_PER_TRANSACTION, "Exceeds max votes per transaction");
    // Existing code
}
```
