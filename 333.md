# Incorrect `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` Fee Cap Configuration

### Summary

One of the limitations set on the contract is that maximum total fees cannot exceed 10% and this is enforced by `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` which is supposed to be set to 1_000 in BP (10%) but due to incorrect configuration, MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10_000 in BP (100%)

### Root Cause

in [EthosVouch::checkFeeExceedsMaximum()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L996) 
```solidity
 function checkFeeExceedsMaximum(uint256 currentFee, uint256 newFee) internal view {
    uint256 totalFees = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints +
      exitFeeBasisPoints +
      entryDonationFeeBasisPoints +
      entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints +
      newFee -
      currentFee;
    if (totalFees > MAX_TOTAL_FEES) revert FeesExceedMaximum(totalFees, MAX_TOTAL_FEES);
  }
```
The `totalFees` should not be able to exceed `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` which is 10% but due to `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` incorrectly been set, this allows the totalFees to exceed 10%.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Admin tries to set new fees, although trusted, is able to bypass the limitation imposed on admin and set totalFees > 10%

### Impact

This breaks one of the limitations on values set by admins in the codebase which is 
> For both contracts:
Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%

This makes it possible for total fees set to exceed 10%

### PoC

present in root cause

### Mitigation

`MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000` (10%) should be the correct configuration
