# `ReputationMarket::sellVotes()` doesn't deduct exit fees taken from the Voter from the MarketFunds

### Summary

When selling Votes, the money to be given to the user is decreased by the exit fees, and we decrease the total Market Funds by the amount of user funds without including fees


### Root Cause

in `ReputationMarket::sellVotes()` when selling Votes, we calculate the funds to be sent to the seller, by subtracting the exit fees from his Votes balance.

[ReputationMarket.sol#L1041](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1041)
```solidity
  function _calculateSell( ... ) ... {
    ...

    while (votesSold < amount) {
      ...
      fundsReceived += votePrice;
      votesSold++;
    }
>>  (fundsReceived, protocolFee, ) = previewFees(fundsReceived, false);
    minPrice = votePrice;

    return (votesSold, fundsReceived, votePrice, protocolFee, minPrice, maxPrice);
  }
```

This amount (`fundsReceived`) is the money of user Votes subtracting exit fees from it [1]. Then, we send exit fees to the protocol [2]. Then, we send the seller his money [3]. Lastly, we deduct Market funds by the amount of funds the user receives [4]. 


```solidity
  function sellVotes( ... ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // calculate the amount of votes to sell and the funds received
    (
      uint256 votesSold,
1:    uint256 fundsReceived,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);

    ...

2:  applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

    // send the proceeds to the seller
3:  _sendEth(fundsReceived);
    // tally market funds
4:  marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
    ...
  }
```

The problem here is that the actual ether transferred from the contract is:

1. `exitFees` to the Contract
2. `fundsReceived` to the seller

But we only decrease `fundsReceived` from the Market Funds, which will make Market Funds' internal amount greater than the actual amount of Ether paid from Voters for that market, which will cause draining of the contract in case of graduating it.



### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This will have a more critical problem, where the profile can get `Graduated`, which will allow `GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL` to withdraw the money stored in the market (`marketFunds`). But as the value is greater than the actual ETH sent by Voters for that profile Market (because of not decreasing exit Fees when selling votes), this will result in decreasing the actual Ether balance from the contract, breaking the invariant of actual ETH stored be >= Internal Balance stored in the contract (Market Funds, Escrow).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Subtract the fees sent to the protocol (exit fees) as well as funds transferred to the Seller from the Market Funds.
