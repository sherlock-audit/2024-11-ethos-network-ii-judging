# Malicious user can grief users reputation by spamming markUnhealthy

### Summary

The EthosVouch.sol contract can allow malicious users to repeatedly damage target profiles reputations through low-cost vouch/unvouch cycles that marks a user as unhealthy.

### Root Cause

The contract allows users to:
Vouch with minimal amount (0.0001 ETH) - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L330
Unvouch immediately and Mark the vouch as unhealthy  - https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L487
Repeat this again and again as this is very cheap to do(no cooldown on vouch and unvouch) and can easily damage the reputation of an user


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

should have 1 verified address on ethos

### Attack Path

Attacker identifies target profile
Each cycle costs only 0.0001 ETH (as this is a constant - uint256 private constant ABSOLUTE_MINIMUM_VOUCH_AMOUNT = 0.0001 ether;)plus gas  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L119
Each cycle creates permanent record of unhealthy interaction as it marks `v.unhealthy = true;`

### Impact

Permanent negative reputation records(note - the bool is marked `v.unhealthy = true;` when the function `markUnhealthy`is used)so whatever amount a user has staked while using vouch, the impact of markunhealthy will be the same as `v.unhealthy = true;` so it holds the same value for everyone)
No way to remove unhealthy marks
New people would not want to vouch for this particular user as there reputation is low
