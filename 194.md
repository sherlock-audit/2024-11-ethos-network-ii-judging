# Vouches Can Be Unvouched to an Incorrect Address

### Summary

The `EthosVouch.increaseVouch()` function allows addresses other than the original author to increase the vouch amount. When unvouching, the total vouch amount is sent to the original author address, potentially leading to loss of funds.


### Root Cause

- The [EthosVouch.increaseVouch()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426-L444) function permits an address other than the original author to increase the vouch amount.
-  The [EthosVouch.unvouch()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L452-L481) function transfers the total vouch amount to the original author address:
```solidity
    if (vouches[vouchId].authorAddress != msg.sender) {
      revert AddressNotVouchAuthor(vouchId, msg.sender, vouches[vouchId].authorAddress);
    }
    ------ SKIP ------
    (bool success, ) = payable(v.authorAddress).call{ value: toWithdraw }("");
```


### Internal pre-conditions

- A profile ID is associated with multiple addresses.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `voucherA` vouches `1 ether` to `subjectA` using address `addrA1`.
2. `voucherA` increase the vouch amount by `1 ether` using a different address `addrA2`.
3. `addrA1` address becomes compromised.
4. The attacker calls `unvouch()` from `addrA1`, withdrawing the total `2 ethers` to `addrA1`.


### Impact

Funds can be withdrawn to an address other than the one that contributed them, violating the intended behavior described in the [comments](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L456-L458):
> because it's $$$, you can only withdraw/unvouch to the same address you used to vouch. however, we don't care about the status of the address's profile; funds are always attached to an address, not a profile

This creates a significant risk of fund misappropriation, especially in cases where one address in a profile ID's set becomes compromised.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the following check in the `EthosVouch.increaseVouch()` function:
```solidity
    if (vouches[vouchId].authorAddress != msg.sender) {
      revert AddressNotVouchAuthor(vouchId, msg.sender, vouches[vouchId].authorAddress);
    }
```
