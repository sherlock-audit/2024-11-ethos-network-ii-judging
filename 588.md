# `marketFunds` accounting is not correct in `ReputationMarket.sellVotes()`

### Summary

In the implementation of `ReputationMarket.sellVotes()`, `marketFunds` accounting is not correct and this will cause lack of funds in `ReputationMarket` contract.

### Root Cause

`marketFunds` is wrongly decreased by `fundsReceived`, and `protocolFee` is applied before it. So `protocolFee` will be sent twice from `ReputationMarket` contract.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

`protocolFee` will be sent twice from `ReputationMarket`. So this will cause lack of funds in `ReputationMarket`.

### PoC

As we can see from [L522](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L522) of `ReputationMarket.sellVotes()`, `marketFunds` is decreased by `fundsReceived`. 

```solidity
   marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
```

`protocolFee` is already sent to the fee receiver in L517.

```solidity
    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);
```

In `ReputationMarket.withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()`, this `marketFunds` amount should be sent from `ReputationMarket` contract, so `protocolFee` will be sent twice. And this will cause lack of funds in `ReputationMarket`.

### Mitigation

`protocolFee` should also be decreased in `marketFunds`.
```diff
-    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
+    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived + protocolFee;
```
