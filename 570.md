# Attacker can spam the lowest vouches for a profile with lowest possbile amount.

### Summary

An attacker can block all 256 vouches with smallest possible amount. It will prevent other vouchers from vouching for that profile. Another issues is that the profile owner will not be able to earn more donation fee. For example he could expect some big vouches but due to the fact that attacker took all the spots the profile owner will not earn any more donation fees. Also his trust score will be at the same level (very low level as 256 * 0,0001 = 0,0256 is a very small sum) and his credibility score can't progress. It is worth noting that the most important thing is the value vouched for the profile. Not the amount of the vouches. It means that one vouch for 0,03 ether will be a better outcome for the profile than 256 vouches for minimal absolute value.

Determined attacker can create 256 Ethos profiles (which is possible) and vouch minimum amount from every account to the victim. As a result nobody else will be able to vouch and the profile owner will not be able to receive donations (possible bigger donations than donations calculated based of minimum amount possible).

### Root Cause

The profile can have maximum of 256 vouches. Minimum vouch is 0,0001 ether.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User needs to have an Ethos profile
2. The attacker needs to create 256 Ethos profiles


### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The attacker needs to create 256 Ethos profiles
2. The attacker needs to vouch 256 times from every profile for victims profile
3. The attacker will fill up the profiles vouching space with lowest vouches

### Impact

User's vouching space will be full. As a result he will not be able to earn more donation fees. The donation fees from attacker will be very small. Also the sum of the vouched amount will be very small also possibly leading to very small trust score in the network. Also this disrupts the normal functionality of the vouch mechainsm for that user (DoS) which can last as long as attacker wants it to last.

### PoC

This attack is actually very cheap as the contract will be deployed on Base L2.

It requires gas for creating 256 Ethos profiles.

It requires gas for vouching and 0,0256 ether to vouch for.

Today (05.12.2024) the 0,0256 costs around `$100,75` with ether price `3935.51 $ Per Ether`. (https://eth-converter.com/)

So that attack is financially accessible.

### Mitigation

This mechanism needs refactoring if the protocol wants it to work correctly. I can't provide a certain fix for this issue.
