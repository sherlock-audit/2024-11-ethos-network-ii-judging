# Repeated unhealthy vouches by a single profile results in the subject being impacted multiple times by the same author

### Summary

Vouches that end due to distrust can be marked as "unhealthy" within a limited time period. Marking a vouch as unhealthy will likely lower the score of the subject being vouched for and indicates that the voucher has lost trust in the profile, which is why they want their money refunded. The sponsor [confirmed this](https://discord.com/channels/812037309376495636/1312070624730021918/1312845097813020772) in the public Discord channel. However, once a user has unvouched and marked the vouch as unhealthy, they can simply vouch for the same subject again, unvouch, and mark the vouch as unhealthy again. This allows the subject to be impacted multiple times by the same author.

### Root Cause

In [EthosVouch::vouchByProfileId()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L369), it is only verified that the previous vouch has been unvouched. However, the same author could vouch for a subject they no longer trust and have previously marked as unhealthy, allowing them to mark the subject as unhealthy multiple times and further impact their credibility.

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Alice calls `EthosVouch::vouchByProfileId()` to vouch for Bob.
2. Alice calls `EthosVouch::unvouch()` to unvouch as she no longer trusts Bob.
3. Frustrated with Bob, Alice decides to vouch for him again, only to unvouch and mark the new vouch as unhealthy once more.
4. She can repeat this process indefinitely or until she runs out of funds.

As a result, Bob's credibility score is negatively impacted by multiple unhealthy vouches from the same author.

### Impact

A single profile can mark multiple vouches for the same subject as unhealthy. This means that a single profile can indicate that they lost trust in the profile, which is why they want their money refunded. As a result, the subject's credibility score to be heavily impacted by just one profile, even though it could be the only one distrusting them.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider restricting authors from vouching for the same subject if a previous vouch they made for that subject was marked as unhealthy.
Since people's opinions can change, you should also consider allowing users to unmark a previously marked unhealthy vouch.
