# Misconfigured Maximum Total Fees Exposes Users to Excessive Financial Loss

### Summary

In the `EthosVouch` contract, the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` value is mistakenly set to 100% (`10000` basis points) instead of the intended 10% (`1000` basis points), as stated in the contest documentation. This misconfiguration allows the protocol to inadvertently or maliciously charge excessive fees, causing significant financial losses to users.

### Root Cause

The constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES is incorrectly set to 10000 basis points (100%) in the contract instead of the intended 1000 basis points (10%), as documented in the contest's README file.
