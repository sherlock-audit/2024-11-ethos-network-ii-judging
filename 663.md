# Reward Redistribution for Previous Vouchers on Vouch Increase

### Summary

by calculating fees it sends some of the fees back to us since we are 1 of the ```previousVouchers```

### Root Cause

When ```increaseVouch``` is called it increases the balance of vouches it also calls ```applyFees``` function which ```_rewardPreviousVouchers``` this causes some of the fees that should go to ```previousVouchers``` to come back to us since we already vouched once and our vouch is saved.
