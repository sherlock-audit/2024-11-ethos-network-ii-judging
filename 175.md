# Archived profiles can create market in ReputationMarket

### Summary

[_checkProfileExists](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1061-L1069) function in `ReputationMarket.sol` implements checks to validate if the given profile is valid. However, this function is not used anywhere in the contract, which allows unauthorized users to create markets.

- Here's what the comment says:
```solidity
  /* @notice Verifies a profile exists and is active in the Ethos Profile system
   * @param profileId The ID of the profile to check
   * @dev Prevents market operations involving invalid or archived profiles
   */
```

### Root Cause

- Function to validate a profile and check it's not archived
```solidity
 function _checkProfileExists(uint256 profileId) private view {
    if (profileId == 0) {
      revert InvalidProfileId();
    }
    (bool exists, bool archived) = _ethosProfileContract().profileExistsAndArchivedForId(profileId);
    if (!exists || archived) {
      revert InvalidProfileId();
    }
  }
```
All the functions related to market creation process don;t check if the profile is archived. 
`ReputationMarket::createMarketWithConfig` , `ReputationMarket::_createMarket` and `ReputationMarket::createMarketWithConfigAdmin` 

### Internal pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. User's profile is archived
2. User calls `ReputationMarket::createMarketWithConfig` function to create a market when his profile is inactive

### Impact
