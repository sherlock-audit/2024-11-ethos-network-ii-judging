# Author can slash even if the staked amount is less than 2 ETH

### Summary

According to documentation in [whiteta](https://whitepaper.ethos.network/ethos-mechanisms/slash) - Social Validation - "you become eligible to validate and participate in slashing events if you have a minimum of 2Îž staked cumulative across any Ethos profiles" an author is unable to slash when there is less than 2 ETH in balance in Ethos profiles. However, there is no any checks in 'EthosVouch.sol::slash'.

### Root Cause

No checks in  'EthosVouch.sol::slash' for authors balance > 2 Eth.
