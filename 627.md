### Attack Path

- During sellVotes() user sell their vote tokens against ETH at the current price.
- Inside sellVotes, `_calculateSell()` gets called.
- Inside the function _calcVotePrice() is called which fetches the current price for selling tokens.
```solidity
@-> uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);

    uint256 maxPrice = votePrice;
    uint256 minPrice;

    while (votesSold < amount) {
      if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
        revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
      }

      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
@->   votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
      fundsReceived += votePrice;
      votesSold++;
    }
```
- Then it goes into while loop now here is the problem, _calcVotePrice() again gets called and now as votes have been changed it would return a value less than the above call value as now one vote gets sold.
- After the second _calcVotePrice() the fundsReceived variable gets updated which causes the bug as the votePrice value added to fundsReceived is the value after selling a token second time not with the first time.
- This means votePrice would be smaller value comparing to what actual he should get.
- Due to this 2 times calclation of vote price user's receive less amount of ETH than what it actually should get.

### Impact

Loss of users funds as upon selling vote tokens they get less amountt of ETH than what actually the user should get.

### Mitigation

- `fundReceived` value should be updated before updating the _calcVotePrice()
