# User can avoid paying fees in `ReputationMarket`

### Summary

The `ReputationMarket` is going to be depolyed on Base L2 blockchain. Users can't affect the transaction ordering. The reputation market does not set up fees values in `initializer`. There is a possibility that a user will interact with the smart contract right after deployment and use the current contract state to avoid paying fees.

### Root Cause

We can see that no fees are set in initializer. User can freely interact with the contract when fees are not set up.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. No fees are set up using setter functions

### External pre-conditions

1. User's transaction get's placed BEFORE admin's transaction setting up the fees

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Protocol losses 100% of the fees.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Set up the fees in the `initialize` function.
