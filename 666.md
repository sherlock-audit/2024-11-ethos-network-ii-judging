# Admin can set fees causing total fees to exceed 10%

## Vulnerability Detail

In `EthosVouch`, `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` that can be charged is set to 100% (10000 basis points) instead of the intended 10% (1000 basis points) limit.

In the READMe

>

    For both contracts:
    Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%

This means an admin could unknowingly set fees that add up to more than 10%, causing users to pay much higher fees than they should when vouching or unvouching. This goes against the protocol's intended fee limits and breaks protocol's invariant.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120

## Impact

Users will have to pay much higher fees than the protocol intended, since fees can exceed the 10% limit that was supposed to be in place

## Recommendation

set `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` to 1000 instead of 10000
