# Admin can set fee percentages so that their sum can be as high as 100% for vouchers

### Summary

MAX_TOTAL_FEES is set as a constant to 10000 (100%) which can cause vouchers to pay as much as 100% of their vouching amount as fees, as admins set different fees individually and the only limitation is that their sum will be at max MAX_TOTAL_FEES.

This is an issue since the contest’s README clearly states that “Maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%”.

### Root Cause

In the definition of the [MAX_TOTAL_FEES constant state variable](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120), this variable is hardcoded to the value 10000 (100%).

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to set either of the fees in the protocol, or a combination of them, so that their sum increases above 10%.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Admin sets either of the fees in the protocol, or a combination of them, so that their sum equals more than 10%.

### Impact

Vouchers will need to transfer more ETH when they vouch, or receive less ETH when they unvouch, due to increased fee payments.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change MAX_TOTAL_FEES to 1000 instead of 10000.
