# Malicious Market creators can manipulate their own `ReputationMarket` through unrestricted self-trading and earn double-sided donation fees, undermining the economic model of the Reputation Market

### Summary

The `ReputationMarket` contract allows users to create markets for themselves and subsequently trade in these markets without restrictions. Users with sufficient funds can manipulate their markets to attract other Profiles to participate in their market until graduation, hugely incentivized by a structure where they profit from both self-trading donation returns, resulting in barely paying any fees for purchasing votes and donations from new participants.

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket.sol:442](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L442-L493) there are no checks in place at all to see if the user is purchasing votes for their own market, without limitations malicious users can employ multiple tactics to ensure they make the most profit possible.

The donation mechanism is also a very big incentive to just self-trade until market graduation. 
```solidity
function previewFees(
    uint256 amount,
    bool isEntry
  ) private view returns (uint256 funds, uint256 protocolFee, uint256 donation) {
    if (isEntry) {
      protocolFee = (amount * entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;
      donation = (amount * donationBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;
    } else {
      protocolFee = (amount * exitProtocolFeeBasisPoints) / BASIS_POINTS_BASE;
    }
    funds = amount - protocolFee - donation;
  }
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Malicious user needs to create their own market.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Alice has significant funds and creates a market for herself
2. Alice buys large amounts of trust votes a short period after creating the market, receiving donation fees back.
3. Alice's market appears highly active and trustworthy due to size.
4. Other users see the large market and active trading.
5. As other users buy votes, Alice earns donation fees.
6. Graduation promise creates urgency for others to join.
7. Alice maintains control through continued buying if needed.
8. Alice profits from both self-trade donation returns and fees from new participants.

### Impact

1. Potential abuse of a system that is supposed to rely heavily on reputation.
2. Users with funds can heavily self-trade to inflate their market.
3. They receive donation fees back from their own buys.
4. Large market size and activity attracts other participants.
5. Each new participant generates more donation fees for the creator.
6. Creators can maintain market control until graduation.

### PoC

See attack path

### Mitigation

1. Disable donation fees for self-trading (when market creator buys votes in their own market)
2. Add cooldown periods for large trades by market creators
3. Implement transparency features showing creator's position size and buy/sell activity
4. Consider caps on what percentage of their own market creators can own
7. (Extreme measure) Disable the ability to purchase votes in one's own market, similar to how self-vouching is not possible in the `EthosVouch` contract.
