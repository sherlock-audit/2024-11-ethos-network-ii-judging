# Funds Slashed from Incorrect Vouches in `slash()` Function

### Summary

The `EthosVouch.slash()` function incorrectly slashes funds from the vouch records of an author (`vouchIdsByAuthor`) instead of targeting the vouches for the accused subject (`vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId`). This misdirection results in an inability to punish the accused profile while incorrectly penalizing unrelated profiles.


### Root Cause

- The issue lies in the logic of the `slash()` function. Specifically:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L529
```solidity
    uint256[] storage vouchIds = vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId];
```
Here, `vouchIdsByAuthor` is used to identify the vouches made by the author. However, the intent of the function is to slash funds associated with the accused subject profile. This should be determined using `vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId`.


### Internal pre-conditions

- Vouchers have vouched for the accused subject (`vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId[subjectProfileId]` is non-empty).
- The accused subject has not vouched for any other profile.


### External pre-conditions

- The accused subject (`subjectA`) is found guilty of unethical behavior or inaccurate claims, triggering a slashing event.


### Attack Path

1. `subjectA` is accused of unethical behavior, triggering a call to `slash(subjectA)`.
2. Vouchers have vouched funds for `subjectA` using their profiles.
3. The `slash()` function incorrectly targets `vouchIdsByAuthor`, which represents vouches created by `subjectA` (if any).
4. Since `subjectA` hasn't vouched for any profiles, no funds are slashed from `subjectA`, allowing them to avoid penalties.
5. Vouchers for `subjectA` remain unaffected, leaving the intended punishment unexecuted.


### Impact

- Incorrect Penalty: The accused profile (`subjectA`) avoids penalties, undermining the slashing mechanism.
- Loss of Funds: If unrelated vouches are incorrectly slashed, it results in a loss of funds for innocent profiles.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace the `vouchIdsByAuthor` with `vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId` in the `slash()` function:
```diff
-   uint256[] storage vouchIds = vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId];
+   uint256[] storage vouchIds = vouchIdsForSubjectProfileId[authorProfileId];
```
This change ensures that funds are slashed from the correct vouch records related to the accused profile.
