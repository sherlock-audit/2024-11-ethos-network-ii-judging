# Creates a new reputation market for a profile using a specific market configuration will be created for incorrect market

### Summary

_createMarket input based of marketConfigIndex which will be changed one day in removeMarketConfig

### Root Cause

E.x. user decied to invest in Deluxe tier which initially has index = 1
```solidity
    marketConfigs.push(
      MarketConfig({
        initialLiquidity: 50 * DEFAULT_PRICE,
        initialVotes: 1000,
        basePrice: DEFAULT_PRICE
      })
    );
```
[ReputationMarket.sol#L235](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L235)

Later admin decied to remove delux in favor of another market in `removeMarketConfig`
now market with index =1 will be `Premium` which means user would invest in another market, which is misleading and a loss to user

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

If create market and remove market happens in the same block, 100% probability to invest in incorrect market

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

_createMarket should change input from index to name of the market to not mislead users
```diff
  struct MarketConfig {
    uint256 initialLiquidity;
    uint256 initialVotes;
    uint256 basePrice;
+    string name;
  }
```
```diff
  function _createMarket(
    uint256 profileId,
    address recipient,
-    uint256 marketConfigIndex
+    string marketName
  ) private nonReentrant {

```
