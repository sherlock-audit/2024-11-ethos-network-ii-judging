# Removal of market config will impact parallel market creation

### Summary

Removal of marketConfig swaps elements in array. When users create new market, they specify config index in array. As a result, they will create market with incorrect config because removal swaps indexes.

### Root Cause

- In [ReputationMarket.removeMarketConfig()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L402-L409) it swaps indexes.
- In [ReputationMarket._createMarket()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L336-L339) it uses config index to specify which type of config to use.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to call `removeMarketConfig()` to remove non-last index, for example 1
2. At the same time there must be tx in mempool `createMarket()` which uses config with same index, i.e. 1

### External pre-conditions

-

### Attack Path

1. Let's say there are 3 configs in array: `[config0, config1, config2]`
2. User submits tx to create Market with config1, i.e. configIndex = 0
3. Admin removes marketConfig 1. So entries are swapped and now are following: [config0, config2]
4. User's tx is executed. Market with config2 is created by mistake.

### Impact

The market creator creates market with incorrect config. There is no functionality to create market with correct config anymore.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do not swap entries in array `marketConfigs`. Or add arguments to specify wanted config in `createMarket()`
