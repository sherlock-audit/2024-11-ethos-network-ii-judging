# Restrictive Balance Check Enables Donation Recipient Update Denial and Front-Running Attacks


## Description
A vulnerability exists in the `updateDonationRecipient` function of the `ReputationMarket` contract that allows malicious actors to prevent legitimate addresses from being set as donation recipients through two attack vectors:
1. A griefing attack by pre-emptively sending small amounts to potential recipients
2. A front-running attack that can consistently block recipient updates

## Technical Details
The vulnerability is present in the `[updateDonationRecipient](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L544-L564)` function:

```solidity
function updateDonationRecipient(uint256 profileId, address newRecipient) public whenNotPaused {
    // ...
    require(donationEscrow[newRecipient] == 0, "Donation recipient has balance");
    // ...
}
```

### Attack Vector 1: Pre-emptive Griefing
The function enforces a strict requirement that the new recipient's `donationEscrow` balance must be zero. This creates an attack vector where:

1. An attacker identifies potential future donation recipients
2. The attacker sends a minimal amount of ETH to these addresses, causing their `donationEscrow` balance to become non-zero
3. These addresses are then prevented from becoming donation recipients due to the balance check

### Attack Vector 2: Front-Running
The function is also vulnerable to front-running attacks:

1. Attacker monitors the mempool for `updateDonationRecipient` transactions
2. When a transaction is detected, attacker front-runs it with a small donation to the `newRecipient` address
3. The original `updateDonationRecipient` transaction will fail due to the non-zero balance
4. This can be done repeatedly to consistently block updates

## Impact
The vulnerability enables:
- Denial of service for donation recipient updates through two different vectors
- Forced retention of current donation recipient addresses
- Potential for broader griefing attacks
- Additional gas costs for targeted addresses to withdraw small balances
- Consistent front-running opportunities that can permanently block updates

## Attack Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Pre-emptive Griefing
1. Alice is the current donation recipient for a profile and wants to update it to Bob's address
2. Malicious actor Charlie sends 1 wei to Bob's address via the donation system
3. When Alice attempts to set Bob as the new recipient, the transaction reverts due to Bob's non-zero balance
4. Bob must spend gas to withdraw the tiny amount before being eligible as a recipient
5. If the donated amount is less than gas costs, Bob's address may be permanently blocked

### Scenario 2: Front-Running
1. Alice submits a transaction to update the donation recipient to Bob's address
2. Malicious actor Charlie monitors the mempool and sees Alice's pending transaction
3. Charlie submits the same transaction with higher gas price, sending a minimal donation to Bob's address
4. Charlie's transaction gets processed first, making Bob's balance non-zero
5. Alice's transaction fails due to the balance check
6. This can be repeated every time Alice tries to update the recipient

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function updateDonationRecipient(uint256 profileId, address newRecipient) public whenNotPaused {
    if (newRecipient == address(0)) revert ZeroAddress();

    // if the new donation recipient has a balance, do not allow overwriting
    // this is so rare, do we really need a custom error?
    require(donationEscrow[newRecipient] == 0, "Donation recipient has balance");

    // Ensure the sender is the current donation recipient
    if (msg.sender != donationRecipient[profileId]) revert InvalidProfileId();

    // Ensure the new recipient has the same Ethos profileId
    uint256 recipientProfileId = _ethosProfileContract().verifiedProfileIdForAddress(newRecipient);
    if (recipientProfileId != profileId) revert InvalidProfileId();

    // Update the donation recipient reference
    donationRecipient[profileId] = newRecipient;
    // Swap the current donation balance to the new recipient
    donationEscrow[newRecipient] += donationEscrow[msg.sender];
    donationEscrow[msg.sender] = 0;
    emit DonationRecipientUpdated(profileId, msg.sender, newRecipient);
}
```

## Recommended Mitigation
Consider implementing one or more of the following solutions:

1. **Remove Balance Check**
   - Remove the `donationEscrow` balance check since the function already verifies ownership through profile ID
   - The current balance can be safely transferred to the new recipient
   - This would prevent both griefing and front-running attacks

2. **Add Balance Transfer**
   - Allow the balance to be transferred as part of the recipient update
   - Modify the function to handle existing balances appropriately
   - Include safeguards against balance manipulation

3. **Implement Minimum Threshold**
   - Add a minimum balance threshold for the check to prevent micro-amount griefing
   - Example: Only block updates if balance is above 0.01 ETH
   - Note: This only partially mitigates the issue as attackers can still use larger amounts

4. **Admin Override**
   - Add a mechanism for admins to clear small balances in cases of griefing
   - Include appropriate events and safety checks
   - Consider adding timelock or other mechanisms to prevent front-running of admin actions

5. **Commit-Reveal Pattern**
   - Implement a two-step process for updating recipients
   - First transaction commits to the update with a hash
   - Second transaction reveals the new recipient
   - This prevents front-running but adds complexity and gas costs
