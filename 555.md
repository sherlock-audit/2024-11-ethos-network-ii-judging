# Wrong fee calculation will lead to loss of funds for the protocol.

### Summary

The `calcFee` function returns incorrect amount due to wrong calculation. It will lead to loss of funds every time the fee is calculated. When protocol expects 10% fee this function will return smaller precentge of funds.

### Root Cause

It should calculate the fee as:

`total.mulDiv(feeBasisPoints, BASIS_POINT_SCALE, Math.Rounding.Floor)`

but the calculations are different:

Let's assume that the user provides 100000000000000 (0,0001 -> minimum amount) and the protocol expects 5% TOTAL fee. The protocol should receive `5000000000000` in fees. However the `calcFee` function would return `4761904761904`. This calculations causes around `4.88%` differance in fee value.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Due to wrong calculation the protocol loses significant fee precentage everytime the users vouch.

### Mitigation

Fix the fee calculation so that the protocol charges expected fee amount.
