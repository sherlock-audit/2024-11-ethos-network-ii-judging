# wrong Accounting of market funds in buyVotes could result in lack of funds.

### Summary

In Reputation.sol, market Funds is being over accounted with funds paid. as it includes both fees too.
This could lead to the situation where, market funds will be claimed, that amount would not be there only. As it was calculated two times

### Root Cause

Here root cause is funds paid which is obtained from calculate buy function. includes all 3, protocol fee, donation and votes price.
Now when fucntion iterate forwards, apply fees is being called in which, both protocol fee and donation is being accounted and transfered. 

now when at last marketFunds[profileid]  is being accounted,  there funds paid is used. but here problem would occur as it is being already used. and here only amount accumulated from amount from votes should be there.

### Attack Path

lets consider a scenario as example

When a user wants to buy 4 tokens , and 10 ether msg.value would be there. here there would be market situation when 
fundsPaid would be calculated would be the way as, 0.4 eth as protcol fee , 0.4 eth as donation fee. Now lets consider not refund is there. 

so when apply fees would be called. 0.8 fees would be used. 

but still, when marketFunds is incremented, it is incremented  by 10 ether. But really 0.8 is already used.

so situation could occur when he will claim this , actual it will be not present and it will revert. And it will break the invariant 

### Impact

two times accounting of same fees is there, so situaiton could arise where, it will be withdrawed , actual funds would not be there, and this could break the invariant

### PoC

### Mitigation

when marketFunds[profileId] is incremented, fundsPaid should not be used. instead fees should be subtracted
