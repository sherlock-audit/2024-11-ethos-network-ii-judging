# Inconsistency in MAX_TOTAL_FEES Documentation and Code

### Summary

The documentation states that the maximum total fees cannot exceed 10%, but the code allows up to 100% (MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000 basis points). This discrepancy could deceive users and lead to unexpected fee deductions.

### Root Cause

in 'EthosVouch.sol' line in line 120 -   uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000; - here is maximum total fees 100%, varies from the maximum mentioned in documentation

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

 In a scenario where all fee components (entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints, entryDonationFeeBasisPoints, entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints) are set to their maximum, users might lose the entirety of their funds to fees.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

	•	Update the constant value to 1000 (10% in basis points), or
	•	Clarify the documentation to reflect the current behavior.
