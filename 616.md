# `EthosVouch::markUnhealthy` doesn't check if **author** and **subject** are mutually vouched.

### Summary

According to the [official docs](https://whitepaper.ethos.network/ethos-mechanisms/vouch#mutual-respect), an `author` of a vouch (to an arbitrary subject) can mark it as **unhealthy** if and only if the two are mutually vouched. This doesn't necessarily happen because `markUnhealthy` function is missing a check to see if an `author` and a `subject` are mutually vouched. Right now, just checks to see if `author` has a valid vouch to the `subject`. And with that no magnified rewards of mutually vouched profiles happen because there is no implementation to check if there are mutually vouched.

### Root Cause

[`markUnhealthy`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L496C3-L510C4):
```solidity
function markUnhealthy(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused {
    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
    uint256 profileId = IEthosProfile(
      contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
    ).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);

    _vouchShouldExist(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnhealthy(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBelongToAuthor(vouchId, profileId);
    v.unhealthy = true;
    // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
    v.activityCheckpoints.unhealthyAt = block.timestamp;

    emit MarkedUnhealthy(v.vouchId, v.authorProfileId, v.subjectProfileId);
  }
```
1. Checks if `msg.sender` has a created profile. (`verifiedProfileIdForAddress`)
2. Checks if vouch exists [vouchId -> activityCheckpoints.vouchedAt != 0]. (`_vouchShouldExist`)
3. Checks if the vouch can be set as `unhealthy` by calling this function `_vouchShouldBePossibleUnhealthy`:
```solidity
function _vouchShouldBePossibleUnhealthy(uint256 vouchId) private view {
    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
    bool stillHasTime = block.timestamp <=
      v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt + unhealthyResponsePeriod;

    if (!v.archived || v.unhealthy || !stillHasTime) {
      revert CannotMarkVouchAsUnhealthy(vouchId);
    }
  }
```
This function just checks if the unvouch was made within 24 hours and if it's not `archived`, already set to `unhealthy`. Does not check to see if `subjectProfileId` vouched `authorProfileId`.
4. Checks if `msg.sender` is the author of the vouch id. (`_vouchShouldBelongToAuthor`)

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1. No magnified rewards for mutually vouched profiles as protocol intends.
2. Anyone can set a profile `unhealthy` (if they are an author of a vouch).

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure that there is a function to check whether to profiles are mutually vouched.
Call that function in `markUnhealthy`.

Example:
```solidity
function markUnhealthy(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused {

    ... rest of code

    _vouchShouldExist(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnhealthy(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBelongToAuthor(vouchId, profileId);
    
    // New Check: Verify mutual vouching
    require(
        hasMutualVouch(profileId, v.authorProfileId),
        "Mutual vouching not established"
    );

    ... rest of code
}

function hasMutualVouch(uint256 profileId1, uint256 profileId2) internal view returns (bool) {
    // Implement logic to verify that profileId2 has vouched for profileId1
    return vouchesByProfile[profileId2].contains(profileId1);
}
```
