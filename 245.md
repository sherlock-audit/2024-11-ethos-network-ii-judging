# Attackers can steal market funds.

### Summary

The function withdrawGradedMarketFunds() of ReputationMarket.sol does not prevent re-entrant, which can result in stolen ETH.
Therefore, you should add nonReentrant to the function or set marketFunds[profileId] = 0 before sending Eth.

### Root Cause

In 'ReputationMarket.sol:660', you should add nonReentrant.
