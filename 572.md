# MAX_TOTAL_FEES is wrongly set to 100% which allows totalFees to exceed the expected 10% mark

### Summary

The MAX_TOTAL_FEES invariant gets broken when `checkFeeExceedsMaximum` function does not revert for fees exceeding the 10% mark which is decided in the documentation provided by the Ethos team.

This allows for adding a new fee percentage in basis points in place of either the protocol, donation, voucher and exit fee basis points. The final totalFees can be 10000 at max which is 100% of the amount.

### Root Cause

In EthosVouch contract line 120, the `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` is defined as a constant therefore once set to 10000, it won't change again.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol incurs high taxes on the funds being put in the protocol on good faith for a higher return. This will break the expected 10% `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` invariant.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Change the value to `MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000`
