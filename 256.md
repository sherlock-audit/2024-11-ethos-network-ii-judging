# MAX_TOTAL_FEE is 100% instead of 10%.

### Summary

The protocol is supposed to ensure that no matter what the aggregate fee cannot exceed the constant variable MAX_TOTAL_FEE which is supposed to be 1000(10%) but it is set to 10000(100%) by mistake. 

### Root Cause

[MAX_TOTAL_FEE](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L120) is set to 10000 basis points instead of 1000 basis points.

### Impact

In the ethosVouch contract, there are various fees, namely exitFee,entryDonationFee,entryVouncherPoolFee. To ensure that this fee doesnâ€™t exceed the max constant there is a `checkFeeExceedsMaximum` function to check the bound whenever any of these fees are updated by admin. This works as invariant to ensure that the fee cannot exceed some max threshold but instead of using the threshold as 1000(10%) it is set to 10000(100%)

```solidity
  function checkFeeExceedsMaximum(uint256 currentFee, uint256 newFee) internal view {
    uint256 totalFees = entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints +
      exitFeeBasisPoints +
      entryDonationFeeBasisPoints +
      entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints +
      newFee -
      currentFee;
    if (totalFees > MAX_TOTAL_FEES) revert FeesExceedMaximum(totalFees, MAX_TOTAL_FEES);
  }
```

The impact of this is that the core invariant of protocol is broken and higher fees can eat up all the user value.

### PoC

none

### Mitigation

change MAX_TOTAL_FEE to 1000.
