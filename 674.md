# Lack of slippage protection in sellVotes function

### Summary

The sellVotes function lacks slippage protection, which can lead to the user receiving less than expected funds when selling votes. Slippage protection ensures that the amount of funds a user expects to receive from a transaction is within an acceptable range of the actual amount received. Without this, there is a risk that the user may sell votes at a price that is significantly different from the price they expected.

### Root Cause

Lack of implementing slippage protection mechanism

### Internal pre-conditions

Another transaction to sell a large amount of votes is executed between the initiation and execution of the victim's transaction.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. A user calls the sellVotes function to sell votes for a given market.
2. The function receives the amount of votes to sell and calculates the price, the funds received based on calculated prices.
3. However, there is no check in place to ensure that the fundsReceived is within an range of the expected value.
4. If there is significant price movement between the time the transaction is initiated and processed, the user could receive substantially less funds than expected.

### Impact

Users may unintentionally sell votes at an unfavorable price, leading to a loss of funds.
