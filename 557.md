# Incorrect value used in `buyVotes` function prevents market graduation which leads to loss of funds.

### Summary

`buyVotes` function allows users to buy votes. User sends `msg.value` and the `_calculateBuy` function calculates the `fundsPaid` amount. Inside `_calculateBuy` the `fundsPaid` include the `protocolFee` and `donation`. The `fundsPaid` value is later added to `marketFunds` for particular profile. The issue is that the `protocolFee` will be sent to protocol address and `donation` amount can be withdraw by the market owner. As a result the `fundsPaid` added to `marketFunds` is higher than it should be.

When the protocol want's to graduate the market they will call `graduateMarket` function. This will set market as non-active and the ability to buy or sell votes will be stopped. The issue is that when the protocol wishes to call `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` this call will revert because the function will try to send more funds than it currently has. As a result the funds will be stuck for that market. Users and the protocol will not be able to withdraw the ether.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The market is created 
2. Users buy and sell shares
3. The market is graduated
4. Funds are now permanently stuck

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

100% ether amount associated with that market is permanently stuck in the contract.

### PoC

1. User calls `buyVotes` with `msg.value`. `fundsPaid` calculated in `_calculateBuy` adds protocolFee and donation.

2. The fees are applied to recipients (protocol address and market owner).

The fundsPaid is added to marketFunds and the protocolFee is sent to protocol address. The donation can be withdrawn.

3. `fundsPaid` are added to `marketFunds`. The amount is greater than it should be because it includes the protocol fee which is sent out and donation which can be withdrawn.

4. `graduateMarket` function can be called without any problem.

5. When `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` is called the transaction reverts because it tries to send more ether than is has.

### Mitigation

Subtract protocolFee and donation from `fundsPaid` when adding it to `marketFunds`.
