# Inconsistent accounting in `sellVotes` function.

## Summary
An accounting vulnerability exists in the `sellVotes` function where the market funds are not being correctly updated, potentially leading to inaccurate tracking of the market's total funds.

## code snippet:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L521-L522

## Vulnerability Details
In the current implementation, the `sellVotes` function updates marketFunds[profileId] by only subtracting `fundsReceived`, it does not account for `protocolFee` generated :
```solidity 
marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
```

## Impact
1. Inaccurate market funds tracking
2. Potential Over-reporting of market total value(its substracting < amount for votes sold).

## Recommendations
Modify the market funds calculation to include protocol fees:
```solidity 
marketFunds[profileId] -= (fundsReceived + protocolFee);
```
