# Liquidity Provider in ReputationMarket does not get equivalent shares to redeem liquidity after graduation

### Summary

To create a market, liquidity providers are needed to fund the market creation, and initial votes are assigned to the markets. In DEFI, it is a common practice to assign shares to the liquidity provider which represents the liquidity provided, in the case of ReputationMarket, it will be needed to claim back the liquidity after graduation. It is also important to note that checks will need to be added to the sellVotes to prevent liquidity holders from selling and breaking a core invariant.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L315

```solidity
function _createMarket(
    uint256 profileId,
    address recipient,
    uint256 marketConfigIndex
  ) private nonReentrant {
    // ensure a market doesn't already exist for this profile
    if (markets[profileId].votes[TRUST] != 0 || markets[profileId].votes[DISTRUST] != 0) {
      revert MarketAlreadyExists(profileId);
    }

    // ensure the specified config option is valid
    if (marketConfigIndex >= marketConfigs.length) {
      revert InvalidMarketConfigOption("Invalid config index");
    }

    // ensure the user has provided enough initial liquidity
    uint256 initialLiquidityRequired = marketConfigs[marketConfigIndex].initialLiquidity;
    if (msg.value < initialLiquidityRequired) {
      revert InsufficientInitialLiquidity();
    }

    // Create the new market using the specified config
    markets[profileId].votes[TRUST] = marketConfigs[marketConfigIndex].initialVotes;
    markets[profileId].votes[DISTRUST] = marketConfigs[marketConfigIndex].initialVotes;
    markets[profileId].basePrice = marketConfigs[marketConfigIndex].basePrice;

    donationRecipient[profileId] = recipient;

    // Tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] = initialLiquidityRequired;

    // Refund any remaining funds
    _sendEth(msg.value - initialLiquidityRequired);
    emit MarketCreated(profileId, msg.sender, marketConfigs[marketConfigIndex]);
    _emitMarketUpdate(profileId);
  }
```

No votes were added to the user who created the market in the function above; this makes it impossible for the user to claim  the equivalent votes in erc20 after graduation.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User create market
2. No votes shares were added to the user

### Impact

The liquidity provider or user who created the market will not be able to get back the equivalent of the initial votes created after the market has graduated. This is because there is mapping that connects the liquidity provider to the initial votes created.
