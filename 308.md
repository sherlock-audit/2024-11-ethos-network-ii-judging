# When user increase his vouch, he also receive reward while fee distributing into previous vouches

### Summary

When user would like increase his vouch, he send native currency into function increaseVouch, and part of this value  (fees) is distributing to previous vouches. And of them - user's vouch. 

### Root Cause

in `EthosVouch.sol:426` in function increaseVouch() there is call to internal function applyFees(), which call _rewardPreviousVouchers().  
In this function in loop, part of user's msg.value is distributing to all non-archive vouches, including vouch, which belongs to caller user. 
User should not receive reward from his own msg.value
