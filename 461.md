# Users can game the voucher pool fees denying other vouchers from their rightful fees.

### Summary

The [`EthosVouch::vouchByAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L309) and [`EthosVouch::vouchByProfileId`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L330) functions are used in order to vouch others.
The user who is vouching is charged fees via the [`EthosVouch::applyFees`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L929).
There are 3 types of fees applied when vouching:-
1. Protocol Fee
2. Donation Fee
3. Reward Vouchers pool

Primarily focusing on Vouchers pool fee:-
```solidity
  function _rewardPreviousVouchers(
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 subjectProfileId
  ) internal returns (uint256 amountDistributed) {
   ///  . . . Rest of the code . . . 
    // Distribute rewards proportionally
    uint256 remainingRewards = amount;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < totalVouches && remainingRewards > 0; i++) {
      Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];
      if (!vouch.archived) {
        // Calculate this vouch's share of the rewards
        uint256 reward = amount.mulDiv(vouch.balance, totalBalance, Math.Rounding.Floor);
        if (reward > 0) {
          vouch.balance += reward;
          remainingRewards -= reward;
        }
      }
    }
      ///  . . . Rest of the code . . . 
  }
```
This ensures that everyone else gets rewarded who vouched earlier.
However, there's a path to game this system by leveraging the [`EthosVouch::increaseVouch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426) function:-
Let's consider three users - `UserA`, `UserB` and `UserC`
1. `UserA` vouches for `UserC` by using `0.01` ether.
2. `UserB`, who wants to vouch a total of `0.1` ether would be able to game the system by first vouching the minimum possible amount, let's consider it as `0.01` ether.
3. Now, the `UserB` would use the `increaseVouch` function with `0.09` ether.

This allows `UserB` to gain back fee from vouchers pool rewards which ideally should have gone to `UserA` completely, denying him the rightful rewards.

### Root Cause

The distribution of voucher rewards pool is not being differentiated between [`EthosVouch::increaseVouch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426) and [`EthosVouch::vouchByAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L309)/[`EthosVouch::vouchByProfileId`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L330) as the same [`EthosVouch::applyFee`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L929) function is used in both cases.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Let's consider three users - `UserA`, `UserB` and `UserC`
1. `UserA` vouches for `UserC` by using `0.01` ether, calling the `vouchByProfileId` function
2. `UserB`, who wants to vouch a total of `0.1` ether, would first vouch `0.01` ether into `UserC`, calling the `vouchByProfileId` function.
3. Again, the `UserB` would use the `increaseVouch` function with `0.09` ether.


### Impact

1. This allows gaming of the system denying rightful pool voucher fees to the users who vouched initially
2. The highest loss would be observed to the first and only person who vouched for a subject, as the attacker would nearly take 50% of his rewards.
3. Similarly, collective fee loss would be seen incase where there are more vouchers already present.

### PoC

The test case was added in the `vouch.address.test.ts` file.
Please upgrade the describe function first:- 
```typescript
describe('EthosVouch Vouching by Address', () => {
  let deployer: EthosDeployer;
  let userA: EthosUser;
  let userB: EthosUser;
  let userC: EthosUser;
  let ethosVouch: EthosVouch;
  let unregisteredUser: EthosUser;
  interface Vouch {
    archived: boolean;
    unhealthy: boolean;
    authorProfileId: BigNumberish;
    authorAddress: string;
    vouchId: BigNumberish;
    subjectProfileId: BigNumberish;
    balance: BigNumberish;
    comment: string;
    metadata: string;
    activityCheckpoints: any; // You might want to define a more specific type for this
  }
```
Test case:-
```typescript
  it('should be able to game the system by claiming self rewards on increaseVouch', async () => {
    
    const PARAMS = {
      paymentToken: DEFAULT.PAYMENT_TOKEN,
      paymentAmount: ethers.parseEther('0.01'),
      comment: DEFAULT.COMMENT,
      metadata: DEFAULT.METADATA,
    }
    await deployer.ethosVouch.contract.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setEntryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints(5000);
    await userA.vouch(userC, PARAMS); // Default amount was vouched, i.e 0.1 ether
    // User B wants to vouch 0.1 ether for user C, but to game the system he will first vouch with the a small amount and later increase the vouch to receive rewards
    PARAMS.paymentAmount = ethers.parseEther('0.01');
    await userB.vouch(userC, PARAMS); // Low amount vouched
    console.log('Vouch balance before increaseVouch: ', ethers.formatUnits((await deployer.ethosVouch.contract.connect(userB.signer).vouches(1)).balance));
    PARAMS.paymentAmount = ethers.parseEther('0.09');
    const vouch: Vouch = await ethosVouch.verifiedVouchByAuthorForSubjectProfileId(
      userB.profileId,
      userC.profileId,
    );
    await deployer.ethosVouch.contract.connect(userB.signer).increaseVouch(vouch.vouchId, {value: PARAMS.paymentAmount}); // Remaining 0.09 ether vouched via increaseVouch
    console.log('Vouch balance after increaseVouch: ', ethers.formatUnits((await deployer.ethosVouch.contract.connect(userB.signer).vouches(1)).balance));

    // When the UserB directly vouches 0.1 ether
    // The balance would have been 0.066666666666666666 ether
    // When system is gamed
    // Vouch balance before increaseVouch:  0.006666666666666666 ether
    // Vouch balance after increaseVouch:  0.076666666666666665  ether
  });
  ```

### Mitigation

It is recommended to upgrade the `applyFees` function to disallow distribution of fees to the person who is `increasingVouch`
