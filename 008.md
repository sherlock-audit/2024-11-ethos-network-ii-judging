# `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` will try to send more eth than there actually is

### Summary

In the `sellVotes` function the marketFunds will be updated incorrectly leading to the protocol assuming there are more funds than there actually are.

### Root Cause

When we check the `sellVotes` function we see that it performs the following storage update:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L522
However only the funds received by the seller are subtracted from the `marketFunds` while in fact the actual amount that is being withdraw is fundsReceived+protocolFee.
As a result it will make the protocol assume that his protocolFee is still in the marketFunds, and will try to pull it here in the `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L675


### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

It will happen everytime the `sellVotes` function is executed.

### Impact

Potential DOS as at some point the contract will not have enough assets to call `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds`
Also more assets will be sent anytime `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` funds is called including the fee. - High

### PoC

N/A

### Mitigation

In the sellVotes function calculate the marketFunds as follows:
```solidity 
marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived + protocolFee;
```
