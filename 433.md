# Absence of slippage protection in the `ReputationMarket.sellVotes()` function.

### Summary

The `sellVotes()` function lacks slippage protection.

The sell price depends on the current number of votes. As more votes are sold, the price decreases. As a result, the seller could receive significantly less than expected if others sell earlier.

### Root Cause

The [sellVotes()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L496-L498) function lacks a minimum expected received funds parameter.

```solidity
       function sellVotes(
496:     uint256 profileId,
497:     bool isPositive,
498:     uint256 amount
       ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
         ...

         (
           uint256 votesSold,
505:       uint256 fundsReceived,
           ,
           uint256 protocolFee,
           uint256 minVotePrice,
           uint256 maxVotePrice
         ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);
     
         ...
       }
```

`fundsReceived` is the amount the seller receives, calculated as the total sum of the price of each vote. The price of a vote is determined by the formula:

```solidity
       function _calcVotePrice(Market memory market, bool isPositive) private pure returns (uint256) {
         uint256 totalVotes = market.votes[TRUST] + market.votes[DISTRUST];
922:     return (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] * market.basePrice) / totalVotes;
       }
```

Due to this formula, as more votes are sold, the price decreases. This means later sales result in a lower received amount, highlighting the necessity for slippage protection.

### Attack Path

Let's consider the following scenario:

1. Current state of the market:

    - votes[TRUST] = 100
    - votes[DISTRUST] = 100
    - totalVotes = 200
2. Alice and Bob want to sell their 20 TRUST votes respectively. For them, the expected amounts are:

    - 1st vote: basePrice * (100 / 200)
    - 2nd vote: basePrice * (99 / 199) (as votes[TRUST] is decremented by 1)
    - 3rd vote: basePrice * (98 / 198) (as votes[TRUST] is decremented by 1 again)

      ...
    - 20th vote: basePrice * (81 / 181)
    - Total: basePrice * (100/200 + 99/199 + ... + 81/181) = basePrice * 9.49
3. Alice's transaction is processed first. Current state:

    - votes[TRUST] = 80
    - votes[DISTRUST] = 100
    - totalVotes = 180
4. Then, Bob's transaction is processed. For him:

    - 1st vote: basePrice * (80 / 180)
    - 2nd vote: basePrice * (79 / 179) (as votes[TRUST] is decremented by 1)
    - 3rd vote: basePrice * (78 / 178) (as votes[TRUST] is decremented by 1 again)

      ...
    - 20th vote: basePrice * (61 / 161)
    - Total: basePrice * (80/180 + 79/179 + ... + 61/161) = basePrice * 8.25

As a result, Bob receives `8.25 / 9.49 = 87%` of the expected amount.

### Impact

The lack of slippage protection could result in a significantly lower received amount than expected.

### Mitigation

Implement slippage protection.
