# The fee rates in the `EthosVouch` contract and `ReputationMarket` are incorrectly configured

## Root cause
`EthosVouch` contract:
The `MAX_TOTAL_FEES` was incorrectly set to 100% instead of the intended 10%.

```solidity
  uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
  uint256 public constant BASIS_POINT_SCALE = 10000;
```
`ReputationMarket` contract:
There are three types of fees in the contract: protocol fee, donation fee, and exit fee, each with a maximum value of 5%. This results in the total fee rate potentially reaching as high as 15%.

```solidity
  uint256 private constant MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE_BASIS_POINTS = 500; // 5%
  uint256 private constant MAX_DONATION_BASIS_POINTS = 500; // 5%
```
## Impact
The fee rates in the EthosVouch contract and ReputationMarket are incorrectly configured, which could result in the total fee rate exceeding 10%.
## Internal pre-condition
- None
## External pre-condition
- None


## Mitigation
```diff
- uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 10000;
+ uint256 public constant MAX_TOTAL_FEES = 1000;
  uint256 public constant BASIS_POINT_SCALE = 10000;
```
```diff
- uint256 private constant MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE_BASIS_POINTS = 500; // 5%
+ uint256 private constant MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE_BASIS_POINTS = 250; // 2.5%
  uint256 private constant MAX_DONATION_BASIS_POINTS = 500; // 5%
```
