# No slippage protection implemented for selling votes in ReputationMarket.sol

### Summary

`sellVotes()` function lacks slippage protection, making users vulnerable to losing funds.

### Root Cause

`buyVotes()` protects users from getting less votes than they expected, but `sellVotes()` does not protect users from getting less ETH for their votes.
```solidity
  function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // calculate the amount of votes to sell and the funds received
    (
      uint256 votesSold,
      uint256 fundsReceived,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);

    // update the market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;

    // apply protocol fees
    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

    // send the proceeds to the seller
    _sendEth(fundsReceived);
    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
    emit VotesSold(
      profileId,
      msg.sender,
      isPositive,
      votesSold,
      fundsReceived,
      block.timestamp,
      minVotePrice,
      maxVotePrice
    );
    _emitMarketUpdate(profileId);
  }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

For example:
1. User A and B sell their TRUST votes for the same market at the same time
2. User A's transaction gets executed first, they get the expected returns and the price of TRUST vote goes down a bit.
3. User B's transaction gets executed second, and they get less returns than they might have expected.

### Impact

The users could experience losses when selling votes.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement slippage protection mechanism like in `buyVotes()`
