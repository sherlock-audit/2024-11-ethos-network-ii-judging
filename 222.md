# Vote Manipulation Attack in a Market with Unprotected Vote Price Calculation

### Summary
The attacker can benefit by exploiting the buy and sell prices. 
The algorithm about _calcVotePrice is incorrect.
For example,
if the market was created with an initialvote 1, the attacker buys 2 trust votes and 2 distrust votes.
(The attacker buys one votes per one time).
 The attacker pays a total of 1/2 + 2/3 for trust votes, and 1/4 + 2/5 for distrust votes. 
Then, the attacker sells votes in the order of one trust vote followed by one distrust vote. 
(The attacker sells one votes per one time).
In this case, the attacker receives 3/6 + 3/5 + 2/4 + 2/3. As a result, the attacker gains 9/20.
(The attacker gets the 9/20 benefit about controlling only 4 votes).
Then the attacker buys his votes, the attacker receives lots of benefits by using lots of votes.
This is due to a flaw in the algorithm.
### Internal pre-conditions
By incorrect algorithm of  _calcVotePrice, the attacker can get benefits.
### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path
Due to the incorrect algorithm in _calcVotePrice, the attacker can gain benefits.
To gain more benefits, the attacker buys votes in a way that keeps the amounts of trust and distrust votes in the market balanced, and then sells them in the order of one trust vote followed by one distrust vote.
For example,
if the market was created with an initialvote 1, the attacker buys 2 trust votes and 2 distrust votes.
So marketFunds[profileId] is 2.
If the attacker buys 1 trust and 1 untrust, he pays 1/2+1/3.
And repeat 1 trust and 1 untrust.(pays 1/2+2/5).
Then the attacker sells one by one.
first trust vote(3/6),untrust vote (3/5), trust vote (2/4), untrust vote(2/3).
So the benefit is 8/15.
If the attacker repeats 4 times, marketFunds[profileId] will be 0.
If the attacker repeats the action, the market will fail.

### Impact

The attacker can continuously gain benefits through a Vote Manipulation Attack in a market with an unprotected vote price calculation and the market will fail.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
The _calcVotePrice must be correct.
