# Missing slippage protection in SellVotes function

### Summary

Slippage protection is missing inÂ `SellVotes()`. If the market shifts unfavorably, users might receive less than anticipated. At present, users can only choose the amount they wish to sell without being able to set a minimum acceptable amount for the trade.

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket:495](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495) votes are sold with the following call

```solidity
 function sellVotes( 
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
	)
```

it is not possible to specify the minimum amount of funds the user wishes to exchange for `amount` in votes.

The funds received are calculated in ReputationMarket:501 with a call to `_calculateSell()` which is returns `fundsReceoved` which is the amount the user will receive.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. Alice simulates the selling of votes and believes they will receive `X` funds in return which is the minimum they would accept
2. Before they can send and have their transaction processed the market changes.
3. Alice receives `Y<X` funds because the market moved from the time they simulated the transaction to the time it is processed

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users receive less funds than expected and are "forced" into a deal that they would not have accepted.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Let user input a `minFundsReceived` parameter that makes sure they receive at least the specified amount.
