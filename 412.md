# Reputation market will be insolvent, due to incorrect increase of market funds when buying.

### Summary

The fees are included in the value added to `marketFunds[profileId]`, even though they are sent out to the fee recipient address and are no longer part of the `ReputationMarket`'s balance. This will leave the `ReputationMarket` insolvent, when [withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L660) is called, as the value of  `marketFunds[profileId]` will be greater than the current balance.

### Root Cause

In [buyVotes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L481), the funds added, also include the fees, even though they* are no longer part of the `ReputationMarket`'s balance. 

*Unless a user has claimed his donation rewards, only the protocol fee will not be part of the `ReputationMarket`'s balance. 
### Internal pre-conditions

1. The admin needs to set the entry fee.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Users buy votes
2. Authorized graduation withdrawal address calls [graduateMarket](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L643)
3. Authorized graduation withdrawal address calls [withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L660)

### Impact

The protocol will not be able to send graduated market's funds to authorized graduation withdrawal address, resulting in insolvency.

### PoC

Add this test in `test/reputationMarket/rep.fees.test.ts`

```javascript
  describe('PoC', () => {
    it('should be insolvant on buy', async () => {
      await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setEntryProtocolFeeBasisPoints(entryFee);

      const initialMarketBalance = await reputationMarket.marketFunds(DEFAULT.profileId);

      const balanceBeforeBuy = await ethers.provider.getBalance(reputationMarket.target);
      const protocolFeeBalanceBefore = await ethers.provider.getBalance(protocolFeeAddress);

      await userA.buyVotes();

      const protocolFeeBalanceAfter = await ethers.provider.getBalance(protocolFeeAddress);
      const fee = protocolFeeBalanceAfter - protocolFeeBalanceBefore;


      const balanceAfterBuy = await ethers.provider.getBalance(reputationMarket.target);

      // Contract balance is equal to the initial balance + the bought votes withouth the fees.
      const contractBalance = balanceAfterBuy - balanceBeforeBuy + initialMarketBalance;

      // This is how much is expected to be present in the contract
      const marketFunds = await reputationMarket.marketFunds(DEFAULT.profileId);

      console.log('Current contract balance: ', contractBalance);
      console.log('Current market funds: ', marketFunds);
      console.log('Difference: ', contractBalance - marketFunds);
      console.log('Fees collected: ', fee);
    })
```
```logs

### Mitigation

```diff
  function buyVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 expectedVotes,
    uint256 slippageBasisPoints
  ) public payable whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // Determine how many votes can be bought with the funds provided
    (
      uint256 votesBought,
      uint256 fundsPaid,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 donation,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateBuy(markets[profileId], isPositive, msg.value); 

    _checkSlippageLimit(votesBought, expectedVotes, slippageBasisPoints);

    // Apply fees first
    applyFees(protocolFee, donation, profileId);

    // Update market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += votesBought;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += votesBought;

    // Add buyer to participants if not already a participant
    if (!isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender]) {
      participants[profileId].push(msg.sender);
      isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = true;
    }

    // Calculate and refund remaining funds
    uint256 refund = msg.value - fundsPaid;
    if (refund > 0) _sendEth(refund);

    // tally market funds
-   marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
+   marketFunds[profileId] += (fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation);
    emit VotesBought(
      profileId,
      msg.sender,
      isPositive,
      votesBought,
      fundsPaid,
      block.timestamp,
      minVotePrice,
      maxVotePrice
    );
    _emitMarketUpdate(profileId);
  }
