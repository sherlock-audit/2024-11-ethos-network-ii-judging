# Drain fund from reputation markets due to asymmetric price calculation between ````buyVotes()```` and ````sellVotes()````

### Summary

The ````_calcVotePrice()```` is used to calculation vote price for both ````buyVotes()```` and ````sellVotes()````, and the price calculation is always based on current  ````totalVotes````, this would cause price asymmetry for a same vote between buy and sell. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to drain fund from markets.

### Root Cause
The issue arises on the [L921-922](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L921~L922) of ````ReputationMarket._calcVotePrice()````, I will take a specific example to show the problem.
```solidity
File: contracts\ReputationMarket.sol
920:   function _calcVotePrice(Market memory market, bool isPositive) private pure returns (uint256) {
921:     uint256 totalVotes = market.votes[TRUST] + market.votes[DISTRUST];
922:     return (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] * market.basePrice) / totalVotes;
923:   }
```

Let's say the starting states are as follows:
```solidity
// the default tier of market profile config
market.votes[TRUST] = 1
market.votes[DISTRUST] = 1
market.basePrice = 0.01 ETH
```
Now, we buy one ````TRUST```` vote, we get
```solidity
totalVotes = 1 + 1 = 2
wePay= market.votes[TRUST] * market.basePrice / totalVotes = (1 * 0.01 ETH) / 2 = 0.005 ETH
// after the buy
market.votes[TRUST] = 2
market.votes[DISTRUST] = 1
```
Next, we sell the vote immediately, then
```solidity
totalVotes = 2 + 1 = 3
weReceive = market.votes[TRUST] * market.basePrice / totalVotes = (2 * 0.01 ETH) / 3 = 0.0067 ETH
// after the sell, states returns back
market.votes[TRUST] = 1
market.votes[DISTRUST] = 1
```
By the one buy and one sell:
```solidity
weEarn = weReceive - wePay =  0.0067 ETH - 0.005 ETH = 0.0017 ETH
```
as we have ````0.0017 ETH / 0.005 ETH = 34%```` gross margin, it could cover the fee cost. Hence, the attack is profit. Attackers can repeatedly conduct the attack to drain all fund in the markets.
### Internal pre-conditions

N/A

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

Repeatedly buy and sell a vote

### Impact

market funds can be drained

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
Modifying ````_calcVotePrice()```` like this
```solidity
  function _calcVotePrice(Market memory market, bool isPositive, uint256 isSell) private pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 totalVotes = market.votes[TRUST] + market.votes[DISTRUST] - isSell;
    return ((market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] - isSell) * market.basePrice) / totalVotes;
  }
```
