# No Slippage Protection When Selling Tokens

### Summary

`ReputationMarket::buyVotes` offers slippage protection to ensure a minimum desired amount of votes is obtained based on the ETH sent. However, `ReputationMarket::sellVotes` lacks such protection.

### Root Cause

* [ReputationMarket](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495)

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A user intends to sell their votes.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. An attacker dumps the price of the votes the user intends to sell, either by selling the same token the user plans to sell or by manipulating its counterpart (TRUST/DISTRUST).
2. The user sells their votes.

### Impact

In the worst-case scenario, the user could **lose all their tokens** and receive almost no ETH in return.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement slippage protection in `ReputationMarket::sellVotes` as well.
