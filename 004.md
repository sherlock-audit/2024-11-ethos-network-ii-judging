# Voucher can avoid slashing penalties by front-running with `unvouch()`

### Summary

The [`EthosVouch::slash()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L520) slashes up to 10% of all vouch balances for a given voucher. However, the voucher can front-run the slashing transaction by calling [`unvouch()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L452) and paying the exit fee. If the exit fee is significantly lower than the penalties, the voucher can minimize or avoid most of the losses.


### Root Cause

The current implementation of `slash()` does not account for the possibility of a voucher executing an `unvouch()` transaction immediately before the slashing is finalized.


### Internal pre-conditions

-   The `slash()` function is called to penalize a voucher.
-   The voucher has sufficient time to detect the slashing transaction and front-run it by calling `unvouch()`.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Allowing malicious vouchers to avoid penalties.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

One possible option could be implementing an unvouch queue, unvouch requests can still be slashed.
