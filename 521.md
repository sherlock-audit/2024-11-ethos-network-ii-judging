# SellVotes inflates market funds because it does not include the fee

### Summary

The `sellVotes()` function currently undercounts the funds withdrawn from the market. This is because it does not account for the exit fee paid by the user, which should be removed from the market. As a result, the market's fund balance is inflated,  leading to either a reverts when graduation a market or an inflated withdrawal amount.

### Root Cause

in `sellVotes()` [ReputationMarket:522](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L522) funds are removed from the market
```solidity
marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;

```

This does not include the fee that is paid and calculated in [ReputationMarket:1041](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1041)

```solidity
fundsReceived, protocolFee, ) = previewFees(fundsReceived, false);
```

When the market is graduated we attempt to withdrawal the funds [ReputationMarket:675](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L675)

```solidity
    _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]); 
```

Here we will either withdraw more than we should essentially stealing from other markets or we will revert if this is the final market or if the discrepancy accumulated is large enough
