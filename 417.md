# ReputationMarket will be insolvent, due to unaccounted fees when selling votes

### Summary

When users sell votes, the protocol deducts a fee from their received funds, but fails to subtract this fee from `marketFunds[profileId]`. Since these fees are sent to the protocol fee recipient and removed from the `ReputationMarket`'s balance, this will cause insolvency when [withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L660) is called, as `marketFunds[profileId]` will exceed the contract's actual balance.

### Root Cause

In [sellVotes](), when  deducting from `marketFunds[profileId]`, both the `fundsReceived` (net amount) and fees must be included, since the total amount from selling votes is split between the user's net funds and protocol fees.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to set the exit fee

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Users buy votes
2. Users sell votes
3. Authorized graduation withdrawal address calls [graduateMarket](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L643)
4. Authorized graduation withdrawal address calls [withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L660)

### Impact

The protocol will become insolvent as it will be unable to transfer the graduated market's funds to the designated withdrawal address.

### PoC

Add this test in test/reputationMarket/rep.fees.test.ts

```javascript
describe('PoC', () => {

    it('should be insolvant on sell', async () => {
      // Set only the exit fee
      await reputationMarket.connect(deployer.ADMIN).setExitProtocolFeeBasisPoints(exitFee);

      const initialMarketBalance = await reputationMarket.marketFunds(DEFAULT.profileId);
      console.log('----------------------- Buy Votes-----------------------');
      await userA.buyVotes();
      let contractBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(reputationMarket.target);
      let marketFunds = await reputationMarket.marketFunds(DEFAULT.profileId);

      console.log("Current contract balance after buy: ", contractBalance);
      console.log("Current market funds after buy: ", marketFunds);


      console.log('----------------------- Sell Votes-----------------------');
      const protocolFeeBalanceBefore = await ethers.provider.getBalance(protocolFeeAddress);

      const { fundsReceived } = await userA.sellVotes({ sellVotes: 1n });

      const protocolFeeBalanceAfter = await ethers.provider.getBalance(protocolFeeAddress);
      const fee = protocolFeeBalanceAfter - protocolFeeBalanceBefore;

      contractBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(reputationMarket.target);
      marketFunds = await reputationMarket.marketFunds(DEFAULT.profileId);
      console.log('Current contract balance after sell: ', contractBalance);
      console.log('Current market funds after sell: ', marketFunds);
      console.log('Difference: ', contractBalance - marketFunds);
      console.log('Exit fee collected: ', fee);
    });

  });
```

```logs
    PoC
----------------------- Buy Votes-----------------------
Current contract balance after buy:  25000000000000000n
Current market funds after buy:  25000000000000000n

### Mitigation

```diff
    function sellVotes(uint256 profileId, bool isPositive, uint256 amount)
        public
        whenNotPaused
        activeMarket(profileId)
        nonReentrant
    {
        _checkMarketExists(profileId);

        // calculate the amount of votes to sell and the funds received
        (uint256 votesSold, uint256 fundsReceived,, uint256 protocolFee, uint256 minVotePrice, uint256 maxVotePrice) =
            _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);

        // update the market state
        markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
        votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;

        // apply protocol fees
        applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

        // send the proceeds to the seller
        _sendEth(fundsReceived);
        // tally market funds
-       marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
+       marketFunds[profileId] -= (fundsReceived + protocolFee);
        emit VotesSold(
            profileId, msg.sender, isPositive, votesSold, fundsReceived, block.timestamp, minVotePrice, maxVotePrice
        );
        _emitMarketUpdate(profileId);
    }
```
