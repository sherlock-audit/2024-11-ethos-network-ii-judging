# Missing Pause Protection in `increaseVouch` Function

### Summary

The `increaseVouch` function in the EthosVouch contract lacks the `whenNotPaused` modifier, which is inconsistent with other contract functions and bypasses the emergency pause mechanism. This allows users to continue increasing vouches even when the contract is in a paused state, potentially undermining the contract's safety controls.

### Root Cause

The absence of the `whenNotPaused` modifier in the function declaration:
```solidity
function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable nonReentrant {
// Function implementation
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Contract owner/admin pauses the contract due to discovered vulnerability
2. Despite pause, malicious actor can still:
```solidity
// Contract is paused
ethosVouch.increaseVouch{value: 1 ether}(targetVouchId);
```
3. Transaction succeeds despite pause state
4. Attacker can continue to increase vouches while other protective functions are paused

### Impact


- Bypasses emergency pause mechanism
- Undermines contract's ability to halt operations in critical situations
- Creates inconsistent contract state during emergency
- Allows continued financial operations during security incidents
- Could prevent proper resolution of vulnerabilities
- May impact other paused functions that assume all operations are halted
- Inconsistent pause state across contract functions

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


1. **Immediate Fix:**
```solidity
function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
// Existing implementation
}
```
