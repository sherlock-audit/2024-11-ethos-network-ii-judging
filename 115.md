# Author can avoid portion of fees due to donation rewards distribution flaw

## Summary

The `EthosVouch` contract allows increasing a vouch; however, it does not exclude the author from the donation reward distribution, which diminishes the effect of fees at the expense of previous vouchers receiving fewer rewards.

## Vulnerability Detail

Suppose a scenario where a subject exists with 1 voucher (Alice) and 1 ETH balance. The voucher pool fee is 5%.

1. Bob creates a vouch with 0.5 ETH (Bob's balance: 0.475 ETH, donation: 0.025 ETH)
2. The system rewards Alice: 0.025 ETH (Alice's balance is 1.025 ETH)
3. Bob calls `increaseVouch` with another 0.5 ETH (donation: 0.025 ETH)
4. The system rewards
   - Alice: 0.025 * 1.025 / 1.5 = 0.017083 ETH, Alice's balance is 1.025 + 0.017083 = 1.042083 ETH
   - Bob: 0.025 * 0.475 / 1.5 = 0.00791 ETH, Bob's balance is 0.475 + 0.475 + 0.00791 = 0.957916 ETH

However, if Bob had created a vouch with 1 ETH at the start:
1. Alice's reward: 0.05 => balance = 1.05 ETH
2. Bob's balance = 0.95 ETH

Hence the gain from Bob manipulating via `vouchIncrease` is: 0.957916 - 0.95 = 0.007916 ETH

## Impact

Previous vouchers receive fewer donation rewards while malicious user saves on fees.

## Recommendation

Exclude the author's vouch from the donation reward calculation on the `vouchIncrease` call.
