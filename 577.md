# _checkProfileExists function unused

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1057-L1069
as said in comments it was suppose to be used as a check while creating market but it was not used, which will cause archived users to create a market 

### Root Cause

not calling _checkProfileExists function while creating market 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

admin allowed a profileId to create market but after that user was archived.
protocol has the intention to not allow archived profileIds even though admin give permission to them.

### Attack Path

admin give permission to a verified profileId.
afterwards profileID was archived.
now according to protocol docs archived profiles can't involve in creating markets.
But user have archived profileId can create a market because createMarketWithConfig function was not internally calling _checkProfileExists to verify that given profileID was  not (invalid or archived).

### Impact

ProfileId's which are archived are able to create markets.(which is not intended as per protocol docs)

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
