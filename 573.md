# Reputation Market Token Sale Restriction

### Summary

The Reputation market allows users to hold an unlimited number of votes until they choose to sell them through a bonding curve mechanism. The number of votes can be purchased beyond the initial liquidity provided in the mechanism.

However, the protocol does not allow users to sell their tokens if `markets[profileId]` has a value of 1. The protocol should enable users to sell their tokens under these conditions.



### Root Cause

Users might hold more than 1 token, but the condition incorrectly prevents them from selling for market with config where initial liqudity is 1 or market.votes[Trust] or market.votes[Distrust] is 1.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users are unable to liquidate their positions to retrieve funds from the tokens they have purchased, limiting their ability to manage their investments effectively.
User might want to liquidate his some of the tokens. But there is no mechanism to liquidate it. 


### PoC
```typescript
  it('should allow a user to sell their last token', async () => {
    // buy one positive vote
    await userA.buyOneVote();

    // check initial votes
    let { trustVotes } = await userA.getVotes();
    expect(trustVotes).to.equal(1);

    // sell the last positive vote
    await userA.sellOneVote();

    // check final votes
    ({ trustVotes } = await userA.getVotes());
    expect(trustVotes).to.equal(0);
  });
```

put this test in `test/reputationMarket/rep.market.test.ts` and run 

npx hardhat test 


### Mitigation

To resolve this issue, update the protocol's conditional checks to allow token sales when `markets[profileId]` is 1 . Specifically, modify the `if` statement to permit sales for users holding any number of votes, ensuring that users can liquidate their tokens regardless of the `markets[profileId]` value. Additionally, implement thorough testing to verify the changes and prevent similar restrictions in future protocol updates.

```solidity
    if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] < 1) {
       revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
     }
```
