# Profile owners cannot `unvouch` for another one of their addresses

### Summary

`unvouch` is used by users in order to remove one of their vouches, and declare the end of their support for the given subject. Where when unvouching we always send the funds to the one who created the vouch - `v.authorAddress`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L473-L478
```solidity
    // send the funds to the author
    // note: it sends it to the same address that vouched; not the one that called unvouch
    (bool success, ) = payable(v.authorAddress).call{ value: toWithdraw }("");
```

There is a little note above to signal that we must send the funds to the author, not the address calling `unvouch`. This and the fact that we send the money back to `v.authorAddress` implies that all addresses belonging to a profile would be able to unvouch, but only the address that originally made the vouch would receive the funds.

However there is another check inside `unvouch` that would prevent anyone else, but the vouch creator calling this function.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L459-L461
```solidity
    if (vouches[vouchId].authorAddress != msg.sender) {
      revert AddressNotVouchAuthor(vouchId, msg.sender, vouches[vouchId].authorAddress);
    }
```


This check is contradictory to the way we send the funds and it's statement above. With it only the original vouch author would be able to call this function and the other addresses of his profile would not.

### Root Cause

The explicit check for address instead of profileId.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users with multiple addresses will not be able to `unvouch` for another address of theirs

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider checking if the `authorProfileId` matches instead of `authorAddress`.
