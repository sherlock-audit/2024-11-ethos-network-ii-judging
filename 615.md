# Possibility for storage collision when upgrading

### Summary

The `EthosVouch` and `ReputationMarket` are meant to be UUPS-upgradeable. But by current logic, this can cause some issues in case of upgrade.

### Root Cause

The forementioned contracts are meant to be upgradeable, but currently they inherit contracts that are not safe-upgradeable.

The `EthosVouch` and `ReputationMarket` should inherit `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` instead of the non-upgradeable `ReentrancyGuard`. 

Reference from [OZ](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/upgradeable)

One problem is that non-upgradeable `ReentrancyGuard`, lacks proxy-compatible storage layout, which is necessary for UUPSUpgradeable contracts. Because if the reentrancy guard contract is meant to be upgraded, the new logic will not apply here.

Also these contracts are missing storage gaps, including the inherited ones like `AccessControl` and `SignatureControl` which is inherited by `AccessControl`. This is necessary since both of them contain storage slots.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If deployers perform an upgrade action and a new storage slot is added, this will result in storage collision, because the gaps will be shifted. This applies for all contracts that which occupy storage slots.

### PoC

### Mitigation

1. Use the upgradeable version of reentrancy guard
2. Add storage gaps in the parent and children contracts.
