# Incorrect Condition on `maximumVouches` in `vouchByProfileId` Function

### Summary

The `EthosVouch.sol` smart contract contains a logic flaw in the `vouchByProfileId` function where the condition checking for the maximum number of vouches uses `>=` instead of `>`. This results in an effective cap of `maximumVouches - 1` vouches, rather than the expected `maximumVouches`. This discrepancy may lead to user confusion and restricts the intended functionality of the contract.

### Root Cause

The conditional check in the function:  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L345-L351

```Solidity
 // users can't exceed the maximum number of vouches
if (vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId].length >= maximumVouches) {
    revert MaximumVouchesExceeded(
        vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId].length,
        "Exceeds author vouch limit"
    );
}
```
is incorrectly implemented. The use of `>=` causes the function to revert when the count equals `maximumVouches`, effectively lowering the allowed limit by 1.

### Internal pre-conditions

* The variable `maximumVouches` is set to a desired limit (e.g., 256).
* The `vouchByProfileId` function is invoked.

### External pre-conditions

* A user or contract interacts with the `vouchByProfileId` function to add a vouch.
* The `vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId]` array's length approaches the value of `maximumVouches`.

### Attack Path

While this issue is not an exploit that compromises security, it could lead to operational restrictions:

* A user attempts to add the maximum number of allowed vouches (maximumVouches).
* The function reverts due to the flawed condition, even though adding the maximumVouches-th entry should be valid.
* Users are unable to fully utilize the allowed number of vouches, resulting in user dissatisfaction or misaligned behavior with system expectations.

### Impact

* The flaw impacts the functionality of the smart contract and user experience but does not directly expose the contract to exploits or loss of funds. 
* Users are restricted to `maximumVouches - 1` entries instead of the intended `maximumVouches`.
* Misalignment between expected and actual behavior could reduce trust in the system.

### PoC

* Assume `maximumVouches = 256`.
* A user has successfully added 255 vouches (`vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId].length == 255`).
* They attempt to add one more vouch.
* Expected: The addition succeeds, resulting in 256 vouches.
* Actual: The function reverts with the `MaximumVouchesExceeded` error because the condition `>=` maximumVouches evaluates to true when length `== 256`.

### Mitigation

Update the code to : 
```Solidity
if (vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId].length > maximumVouches) {
    revert MaximumVouchesExceeded(
        vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId].length,
        "Exceeds author vouch limit"
    );
}
```
