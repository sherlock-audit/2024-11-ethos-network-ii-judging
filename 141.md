# Use buyVotes and sellVotes on ReputationMarket to steal money

### Summary

For there is no time set or check on buyVotes and sellVotes. For a specific market if the attacker want to earn money, he can buy any of TRUST AND DISTRUST votes and sell the vote immidiately to earn the money if the fee is less than the diff of buy and sell. From the doc, the contract isn't designed to make others to earn money but to make a reputation market.

The attacker can earn money from buying any TRUST or DISTRUST votes and selling it immediately. For an example, if the market has TRUST votes of number a and DISTRUST votes of number b. The price of buying one TRUST vote's price is a*market.basePrice/(a+b). After buying one TRUST vote, the market has a+1 votes of TRUST and b votes of DISTRUST.Now the attacker can sell the TRUST vote he just buy. The sell money is (a+1)*market.basePrice/(a+b+1). Obviously the (a+1)/(a+b+1) is larger than a/(a+b). If the diff is larger than the fee which attacker will pay, the attacker can steal money from the contract.
