# Critical restriction in `increaseVouch` risks locking user funds permanently

### Summary

The `increaseVouch` functionality has a critical limitation: only the original author address can withdraw or unvouch funds. This creates a situation where users who increase an existing vouch lose access to the funds they contribute. If the original author address becomes inaccessible or the user is otherwise unable to use it, all funds associated with the vouch, including the contributions from other users, are locked.  

### Root Cause

The design enforces that only the original address that created the vouch (`vouches[vouchId].authorAddress`) can unvouch or withdraw funds. This is acceptable by design, but the limitation extends to users who increase the vouch, preventing them from withdrawing their contributions.  

Additionally, the inability to create a new vouch until an unvouch is performed by the original author compounds the issue.  

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A profile has an associated address (`msg.sender`) that created the original vouch.  
2. Another user contributes to the same vouch using the `increaseVouch` function.  

### External pre-conditions

1. The original author address becomes inaccessible to the user (e.g., compromised, lost access, or other reasons).  
2. The user who increased the vouch attempts to withdraw their contribution but cannot, as only the original author can perform unvouch operations.  

### Attack Path

1. A profile creates a vouch using an address (`vouches[vouchId].authorAddress`), as intended.  
2. The system enforces that only the address that created the vouch can withdraw funds—this behavior is **by design**.  
3. A new address associated with the same profile contributes additional funds to the vouch by calling `increaseVouch`.  
4. The original author’s address becomes inaccessible to the user (e.g., due to compromise, account loss, or something).  
5. Since only the original author address can unvouch, the user who increased the vouch via the new address loses access to their contribution.

### Impact

- Contributors who use `increaseVouch` lose access to their contributions if the original author address becomes inaccessible.  
- Profiles cannot create new vouches for the same profile until the original vouch is unvouched, leading to operational constraints.  

### Mitigation

**Resolution Depends on Project Business Assumptions**  
Below is a potential solution:  

1. **Track Contributions Per Address:**  
   Modify the `Vouch` structure to track each address's contributions separately. This ensures contributors retain access to their funds.  

   ```solidity
   struct Vouch {
       // Existing fields
       mapping(address => uint256) contributions;
   }
   ```

2. **Enable Per-Address Withdrawals:**  
   Update the `unvouch` logic to allow individual contributors to withdraw their own contributions without requiring the original author to act.
