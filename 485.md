# `ReputationMarket::sellVotes()` has no Slippage Protection

### Summary

When selling votes no slippage protection guarantees the user (seller) will receive a satisfactory amount of money when he sells his votes

### Root Cause

Buying and selling votes occuar the price for votes and disVotes is determined using both votes and disVotes number. Each buy/ sell process will change the price of buying/selling votes/disVotes.

When buying Votes There is a slippage check that guarantees the user will buy the number of votes he needs, but in `sellVotes()` there is no check weather the user will gain the amount of money he wants when he sell a given number of votes. This will make users receive money when selling votes less that they need in case there was another transactions for before them.

```solidity
  function sellVotes( ... ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // calculate the amount of votes to sell and the funds received
    ( ... ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);
    // @audit Missing Slippage Protection
    ...
    // apply protocol fees
    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

    // send the proceeds to the seller
    _sendEth(fundsReceived);
    ...
  }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

When a given user request to sell votes:
- Another user is selling votes before him
- Another user is buying disVotes before him

When a given user request to sell disVotes:
- Another user is selling disVotes before him
- Another user is buying votes before him


### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The seller of votes/disVotes will receive money less that he needs.


### PoC

- userA buy a vote with `0.0050e18`
- userB buy a vote with `0.0066e18`
- userC buy a vote with `0.0075e18`
- userA wants to sell his vote (it not worths `0.0075e18` (50% profit)
- userA made the tx
- userB requested for selling before userA (userA didn't know that his tx is in mempool first)
- userB will receive `0.0075e18`
- userA will receive `0.0066e18` (33% profit only)

### Mitigation

add a minimum amount to receive parameter and check that the received money is greater than or equals that value.
