# ReputationMarket::_calculateSell returns incorrect maxPrice

### Summary

The `_calculateSell` function returns incorrectly calculated `maxPrice` when a user sells votes.
Here is where the in incorrect value is returned:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1044

### Root Cause

Here is the incorrect code:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1026-L1029

In the beginning of the function the `votePrice` is calculated with `_calcVotePrice` then shortly after the total number of votes is decreased on line #1036
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1036

Thus, the actual max price will be the next calculated price on line #1037
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1037

Then the incorrect max price for a vote will be incorrect.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Incorrect `maxPrice` is returned from the `_calculateSell` function.

### PoC

Import hardhat console into the `ReputationMarket.sol` contract:
```solidity
//@audit added
import "hardhat/console.sol";
```

Add the following loggers after line #1042
```solidity
        console.log("The total selling funds received is:", fundsReceived);
        console.log("The maxVotePrice when selling is:", maxPrice);
        console.log("The min vote price is: ", minPrice);
        console.log("The number of votes sold is:", votesSold);
``` 
Paste the following test into the `rep.market.test.ts` 

```typescript
 it('The max price is incorrect is _calculateBuy', async () => {
    const { fundsPaid } = await userA.buyOneVote();
    const { fundsReceived } = await userA.sellOneVote();
  });
```
After running the test you will get an output like this

```shell
 ReputationMarket
The total selling funds received is: 5000000000000000
The maxVotePrice when selling is: 6666666666666666
The min vote price is:  5000000000000000
The number of votes sold is: 1
```

If a user is selling a ONE vote then the max, min, and funds received should all be the same. However, you can see the `maxPrice` is different and incorrect it should be `5000000000000000`




### Mitigation

Make the following changes to the `ReputationMarket::_calculateSell` function

```diff
+   market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
    uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);

    uint256 maxPrice = votePrice;
    uint256 minPrice;

    while (votesSold < amount) {
      if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
        revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
      }

-      market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
      votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
      fundsReceived += votePrice;
      votesSold++;
+   market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
    }

```
