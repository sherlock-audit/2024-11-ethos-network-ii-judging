# No Maximum Price Slippage Protection in Sell Votes

### Summary

The `sellVotes()` function lacks a mechanism to specify minimum received amount, unlike `buyVotes` which has slippage protection. This could lead to sellers receiving significantly less ETH than expected due to price movements.

### Root Cause

In `buyVotes`, there's slippage protection:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L461

```solidity
function buyVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 expectedVotes,
    uint256 slippageBasisPoints  // Allows user to set maximum slippage
) public payable {
    // ...
    _checkSlippageLimit(votesBought, expectedVotes, slippageBasisPoints);
}
```
However, `sellVotes` has no such protection:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495

```solidity
function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
) public {
    // ...
    (uint256 votesSold, uint256 fundsReceived, ...) = _calculateSell(...);
    
    // No check for minimum received funds
    _sendEth(fundsReceived);
}
```

Each vote sale progressively gets a lower price in `_calculateSell`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1031-L1040

```solidity
while (votesSold < amount) {
    market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
    votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive); // Price decreases with each sale
    fundsReceived += votePrice;  
    votesSold++;
}
```

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Price could drop significantly between transaction submission and execution & users might receive much less ETH than expected for their votes.

### Mitigation

Implement a slippage protection on `sellVotes()`
