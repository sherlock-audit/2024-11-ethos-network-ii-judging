# incorrect balance update

### Summary

when users buy a vote the funds they used fundsPaid is the total amount they spent for buying votes which includes donation vote price and protocol fee however when updating the market balance the whole amount the users paid including protocol fee donation is added to the market funds which results in the market funds being inflated

    // Add buyer to participants if not already a participant
    if (!isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender]) {
      participants[profileId].push(msg.sender);
      isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = true;
    }


    // Calculate and refund remaining funds
    uint256 refund = msg.value - fundsPaid;
    if (refund > 0) _sendEth(refund);


    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;   ////----->@audit here
    emit VotesBought(
      profileId,
      msg.sender,
      isPositive,
      votesBought,
      fundsPaid,
      block.timestamp,
      minVotePrice,
      maxVotePrice
    );
    _emitMarketUpdate(profileId);
  
 

the funds paid is actually the full amount user used for executing the whole transaction including protocol fee/donation which is not meant for the market as we can see here

this is problematic because the protocol fee is not meant for the market funds this will result in an inflated balance of market funds
and when the authorized address calls  withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds it will try to withdraw this inflated balance which will cause a revert when trying to withdraw more than the actual balance or it can lead to a drainage of funds that were not meant for the market funds

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The incorrect update can cause the contract to run out of funds faster than expected or lead to withdrawal of more balance than the actual balance of market that were not meant for the market, as the contract will believe it has more available funds than it does. 


If the balance is not updated properly, the contractâ€™s internal state will not reflect the true available funds. This can lead to situations where the contract may unintentionally revert transactions due to an inconsistent state. leading to funds being stuck or it will withdraw funds that were not meant for that particular market


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

update the balance correctly only add funds that are meant for the market
