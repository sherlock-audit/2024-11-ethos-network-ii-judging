# User could increase his vouch, while pause mode is on

### Summary

Contract has pauseMode protection. Which means that important functions could be disabled, when pause mode is ON. 
But function increaseVouch() could be called, while contract has paused.

### Root Cause

In `EthosVouch.sol:426` function increaseVouch() could be called when contract has paused, because this function dont have whenNotPaused modifier. So, contract state could be changed at this moment and eth will be send(fee) from contract. 
Such important things should not be executed when contract has paused.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User has vouch

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User create vouch
2. Owner turn on pause mode
3. User increase value of his vouch

### Impact

Contract state changed while contract has paused. 
Pause mode uses for maintenance or critical situations. so users should not interact with contract at this moment, because it could interfere with the administrator's work with the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add modifier whenNotPaused to function increaseVouch()
```diff
function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable 
    nonReentrant  
+  whenNotPaused
{
   ....
```
