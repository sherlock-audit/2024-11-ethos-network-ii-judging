# Authorized actor could drain the protocol with reentrancy at ReputationMarket::withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()

### Summary

As the protocol says and also the natspec:
`Only Ethos, through a designated contract, will be authorized to graduate markets and withdraw funds to initiate this conversion process.`

The function can be reentered by authorized actor. Even if they are trusted, this should not be allowed in the code.
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Withdraws funds from a graduated market
     * @dev Only callable by the authorized graduation withdrawal address
     * @param profileId The ID of the graduated market to withdraw from
     */
    function withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(uint256 profileId) public whenNotPaused {
        address authorizedAddress = contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName("GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL");
        if (msg.sender != authorizedAddress) {
            revert UnauthorizedWithdrawal();
        }
        _checkMarketExists(profileId);
        if (!graduatedMarkets[profileId]) {
            revert MarketNotGraduated();
        }
        if (marketFunds[profileId] == 0) {
            revert InsufficientFunds();
        }

        // @audit basic reentrancy here. Must reset the funds and then send the eth.
        _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]);
        emit MarketFundsWithdrawn(profileId, msg.sender, marketFunds[profileId]);
        marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
    }
```

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L677

The state is updated after the eth is send. It should be done before that.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Actor must add the malicious contract address at `ContractAddressManager::updateContractAddressesForNames()`
2. Authorized actor must buy some votes so the `marketFunds[profileId]` can increase.
3. The authorized actor must call `graduateMarket()`. 
4. Authorized actor must call `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()`
5. There needs to be eth in the contract, so it can be reentered.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Add the malicious contract address(only owner can do that).
2. Buy votes with the malicious contract, so the marketFunds can increase.
3. Call `graduateMarket()` with the malicious contract. 
4. Call `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()` with the malicious contract.
5. There needs to be eth in the contract, so it can be reentered.

### Impact

Impact - High
Likelyhood - Low

Protocol can be drained by reentering.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Applying this changes will stop the re-entering.
You also could just use the `NonReentrant` modifier.
