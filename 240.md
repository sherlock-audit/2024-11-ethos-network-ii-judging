# # Sandwich Attack


### Summary
The seller can lose their funds due to a sandwich attack.

### Root Cause
In the `ReputationMarket.sol::sellVotes()` function, there is no slippage check.

### Internal pre-conditions
N/A

### External pre-conditions
N/A

### Attack Path
1. The attacker sells their votes.
2. The victim sells their votes.
3. The attacker buys their votes back.
There is a specific description in poc.

### Impact
The seller may lose their funds.

### PoC

```solidity
495:    function sellVotes(
            uint256 profileId,
            bool isPositive,
            uint256 amount
        ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
            _checkMarketExists(profileId);

            // calculate the amount of votes to sell and the funds received
            (
            uint256 votesSold,
            uint256 fundsReceived,
            ,
            uint256 protocolFee,
            uint256 minVotePrice,
            uint256 maxVotePrice
            ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);

            // update the market state
            markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
            votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;

            // apply protocol fees
            applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

            // send the proceeds to the seller
            _sendEth(fundsReceived);
            // tally market funds
            marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
            emit VotesSold(
            profileId,
            msg.sender,
            isPositive,
            votesSold,
            fundsReceived,
            block.timestamp,
            minVotePrice,
            maxVotePrice
            );
            _emitMarketUpdate(profileId);
        }
```
Assume that `market.votes[0] := v0`, `market.votes[1] := v1`, and `market.basePrice := b`.
The victim attempts to sell `n` `vote0`s.
Before that, the attacker sells their `m` `vote0`s.
The victim sells their `n` `vote0`s.
Finally, the attacker buys back `m` `vote0`s.
At that time:
    `f1 := b * sum((v0 -1 -i)/(v0 +v1 -1 -i)) (i=[0,n-1])`
    `f2 := b * sum((v0 -m -1 -i)/(v0 -m +v1 -1 -i)) (i=[0,n-1])`
    `f3 := b * sum((v0 -1 -i)/(v0 +v1 -1 -i)) (i=[0,m-1])`
    `f4 := b * sum((v0 -n -m +i)/(v0 -n -m +v1 +i)) (i=[0,m-1])`
    The exit fee rate is given by `exitfeerate := (10000 - exitProtocolFeeBasisPoints) / 10000 >= 0.95`
    The entry fee rate is given by `entryfeerate := (10000 - entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints - donationBasisPoints) / 10000 >= 0.9`
    The victim's original received funds are `orf = f1 * exitfeerate`
    However, their real received funds are `rrf = f2 * exitfeerate`
    The victim's lose funds are `vlf = orf -rrf >= (f1 - f2) * 0.95`
    The attacker receives = `arf = f3 * exitfeerate - f4 / entryfeerate >= f3 * 0.95 - f4 / 0.9`
    when `v0 = 5`,`v1 = 5`,`n = 1`, and `m = 1`: 
        `f1 = b * 0.44444`, 
        `f2 = b * 0.375`, 
        `f3 = b * 0.44444`,
        `f4 = b * 0.375`, 
        `vlf >= b* 0.06597`, 
        `arf >= b * 0.00555`.
    when `v0 = 2000`,`v1 = 2000`,`n = 500`, and `m = 500`: 
        `f1 = b*232.90150`, 
        `f2 = b * 191.65102`, 
        `f3 = b * 232.90150`,
        `f4 = b * 191.65102`, 
        `vlf >= b * 39.18796`,
        `arf >= b * 8.31085`.
