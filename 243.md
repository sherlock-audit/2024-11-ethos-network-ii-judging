# `sellVotes()` function in `ReputationMarket.sol` does not check slippage

### Root Cause

`sellVotes()` in `ReputationMarket.sol` does not allow the caller to set an acceptable slippage value. Any calls to this function can be sandwiched, and are subject to indefinite losses.

### External pre-conditions

A malicious actor with a large quantity of votes is monitoring the mempool for `sellVotes()` calls.

### Attack Path

1. The mempool is monitored for a large sale of votes.
2. `sellVotes()` is called authentically.
3. The attacker submits a `sellVotes()` call with less gas, and an equal `buyVotes()` call with more gas than the authentic transaction.
4. The authentic transaction executes at a much lower price than intended, and the attacker buys back their original quantity of votes at a lower price.

### Impact

The attacker pays protocol fees for their buy and sell transactions, the affected party receives a lower than expected quantity of ETH.

### Mitigation

Implement a slippage checking function similar to the one in `buyVotes()`.
