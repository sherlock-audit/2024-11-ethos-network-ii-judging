# Insufficient Profile Verification

### Summary

In `vouchByAddress()` function the `profile.verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender)` method is called without checking its return value. This will make the function continue execution regardless of the verification status and allow unverified users to vouch for profiles.
