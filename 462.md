# Changing the configuration through the removeMarketConfig function may affect the configuration when creating the market, which may cause users to create markets with unexpected configurations.

### Summary

Changing the configuration through the removeMarketConfig function may affect the configuration when creating the market, which may cause users to create markets with unexpected configurations.
Specifically, when the user creates a market using index x via the createMarketWithConfig function. It so happens that admin removes an index via the removeMarketConfig function in the same block or in a similar block. This will exist in two cases.
1. the user's index x is the last one configured, which will make the user use the wrong index and the creation fails, this has little effect.
2. if the user's index x happens to be the index that was removed, then the user is now using an unintended (originally last configuration) creation. This may have changed the level of volatility in the market. against the user's expectations.

### Root Cause

In [ReputationMarket.sol#L389](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L389), configurations cannot be removed while paused.
In [ReputationMarket.sol#L318](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L318), when creating a market, the configuration is selected based on the index.

### Attack Path

### Impact

Users may be forced to use unintended configurations due to changes in the configuration index, affecting the level of volatility in the market.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It is recommended to pause before removing the configuration to avoid this situation. Therefore, the function that removes the configuration should check that it must be called during a pause.
```diff
-  function removeMarketConfig(uint256 configIndex) public onlyAdmin whenNotPaused {
+  function removeMarketConfig(uint256 configIndex) public onlyAdmin whenPaused {
```
