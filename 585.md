# Constant Variables Could Cause Users to Overpay or Face Transaction Reverts in the Future

## Summary
As stated in the Ethos documentation: https://whitepaper.ethos.network/ethos-mechanisms/vouch#financial-stakes:~:text=Vouching%2C%20unlike%20Review%2C%20requires%20a%20backing%20asset%3A%20staked%20Ethereum%20(and%20in%20the%20future%2C%20other%20assets)\
The protocol plans to accept USDC and other assets, but constant values in EthosVouch and ReputationMarket are hardcoded for ETH, potentially causing issues.
## Vulnerability Detail
EthosVouch:
In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L380
and https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L428
ABSOLUTE_MINIMUM_VOUCH_AMOUNT is fixed at 0.0001 ETH (10^14 wei).
Functions like vouchByProfileId and increaseVouch will require disproportionately high amounts when using assets like USDC.



ReputationMarket:
In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L370
DEFAULT_PRICE and MINIMUM_BASE_PRICE are 0.01 ETH (10^16 wei) and 0.0001 ETH (10^14 wei), respectively.
Functions like addMarketConfig demand excessively large asset amounts when configured for assets other than ETH.

## Impact
When a user deposits assets like USDC (10^6 decimals), they may be required to deposit amounts significantly higher than expected or face transaction reverts. Fees for such deposits are also disproportionate compared to ETH.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Replace constant values with dynamic multipliers that account for asset decimals, similar to Ethereum Credit Guild's approach.
This ensures future compatibility with various assets while maintaining fair deposit requirements.
