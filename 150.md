# Vouchers Can Avoid Getting Slashed By Vouching For Different Profiles To Reach Max Limit

## Description

**Context:**

A user with a valid Ethos profile can [vouch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L330-L415) for another profile by depositing ETH, signaling that the vouched profile is trustworthy (either as a protocol or user). In the Ethos Protocol, any user with an active profile can accuse others of unethical behavior, which this actor is referred to as `whistleblower`.

When an accusation is made by `whistleblower`, it triggers a `24-hour` lock period for the voucher, preventing them from unvouching and withdrawing their deposited ETH. Validators in the Ethos Protocol are responsible for voting on the accusation validity. If they agree with the `whistleblower`, the whistleblower can slash the voucher, by taking a portion of the deposited ETH from each vouch associated with specified voucher, up to `10%` of the total.

*For details on slashing, refer to the [slash()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L514-L555) function and the [Ethos docs](https://whitepaper.ethos.network/ethos-mechanisms/slash#slashing).*

**Vulnerablity Details:**

A malicious actor can exploit the system to avoid getting their vouches slashed by vouching for a large number of profiles and eventually reaching the maximum limit, where no further vouching is possible.

This action makes the slashing operation gas-intensive due to the need to loop through many vouch IDs using a [for loop](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L529-L545). (Note: The maximum number of vouch IDs associated with a single profile is [256](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L287), meaning the loop will iterate up to 256 times). Additionally, the process involves frequent storage reads and writes, which are gas expensive operation in solidity.

A malicious actor could execute this strategy at minimal cost, as the lowest amount required to vouch for a profile is [0.0001 ETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L119). By vouching for `256 profiles`, the total cost would only be `0.0256 ETH`.

## Impact

**Damage:** Medium

**Likelihood:** Medium

**Details:** A malicious voucher can deliberately vouch for a large number of profiles, eventually reaching the maximum limit where no further vouching is possible, to avoid getting slashed and penalized for unethical acts he has done.

## Proof of Concept

**Attack Path:**

1. A whistleblower detects unethical behavior by a voucher and accuses them. This results in the voucher funds being locked for 24 hours, which leads to voucher being unable to unvouch and withdraw his deposited ETH during this period.
2. Validators agree the accusation is valid, enabling the whistleblower to initiate slashing. 
3. whistleblower calls [slash()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L514-L555) function on voucher. unfortunetly fails because voucher has vouched for `256` different profiles (max limit). as result, when in `slash()` function looping through each vouch of the voucher (256 times) and reading/writing from/to storage, it will cost alot of gas and cause exceeding block gas limit which will lead to revert and `whistleblower` will be unable to punish voucher for unethical act.

**POC:**

- Not Needed

## Recommended Mitigation

The `slash()` function should be designed in a way, to allow slashing a single vouch at a time, selected by the `whistleblower`. This reduces the gas overhead and ensures the system can effectively penalize unethical vouchers.
