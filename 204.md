# `EthosVouch::unvouch` allows the accused avoid slashing during the accusation period

### Summary

The design of [slashing in whitepaper](https://whitepaper.ethos.network/ethos-mechanisms/slash) is to have `whistleblower` to notify the protocol and this accusation would trigger a timelock for the vouch functions before the actual slashing is executed by the protocol.

But function `vouch` and `unvouch` in `EthosVouch` cannot check whether the author of `vouchId` is in the accusation period or not.

This would make possible for anyone to avoid slashing by calling `unvouch` at the accusation period.


### Root Cause

If we look into `slash` function, the slash would [only happen to vouch that is not archived](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L534), and the only way to mark a vouch to archived state is to call `unvouch`

The root cause is because `unvouch` only check if the author's vouch is exist, and also not already archived. There are no way the contract knows if the period of accusation already started for said author of vouch, so the contract can not lock the vouch functions.


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. alice accuse bob for unethical behavior by pledging nominal to validators
2. human verification are needed so there would be time before the slashing happens
3. bob saw alice tx that accuse him for unethical behavior
4. bob then calls `unvouch` for all of his vouchId
5. bob avoid slashing

### Impact

Anyone can avoid slashing if they call `unvouch` in the accusation period where they need human validation to validate the malicious behavior of the author.

There are no incentive for `whistleblower` to accuse because they lose the fund they staked for starting accusation without gaining anything.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

add new element `bool accused` in the `Vouch` struct, and modify `_vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch` to also check againts the value of `accused`.
this would effectively makes the `vouch` and `unvouch` locked if the author is in the accused period.

add new function `accuse` and `pardon` that only slasher can call to change the `accused` status for the provided `authorProfileId`.
