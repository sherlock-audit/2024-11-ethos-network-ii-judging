# `markUnhealthy` restricts vouch marking to voucher, contradicting whitepaper specifications

### Summary

The `markUnhealthy` function in the `EthosVouch` contract restricts marking a vouch as unhealthy to the voucher (author of the vouch). However, the [Ethos Whitepaper](https://whitepaper.ethos.network/ethos-mechanisms/vouch#unvouch) specifies that the **subject of the vouch** (vouchee) should also be able to mark it as unhealthy within 24 hours after an unvouch. This discrepancy prevents the subject from signaling that the vouch ended on poor terms, which is an essential feature for network trustworthiness.

### Root Cause

The `markUnhealthy` function calls `_vouchShouldBelongToAuthor`, which ensures that only the voucher (authorProfileId) can execute the function. There is no provision for the subject (subjectProfileId) to mark the vouch as unhealthy.

Relevant code in `markUnhealthy`:

```solidity
_vouchShouldBelongToAuthor(vouchId, profileId);

if (vouches[vouchId].authorProfileId != author) {
    revert NotAuthorForVouch(vouchId, author);
}
```

This logic prevents the subject from marking the vouch as unhealthy, contrary to the whitepaper.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. A voucher creates a vouch for a subject.
2. The voucher unvouches, and the vouch is marked as archived.
3. The subject attempts to call `markUnhealthy` on the archived vouch.
4. The transaction reverts with the error `NotAuthorForVouch`.


### Impact

This issue results in a functional deviation from the Ethos Whitepaper's described mechanism, which could reduce trust signaling efficiency. By restricting the marking of unhealthy vouches to the voucher, the contract fails to:
- Allow subjects to react to an unvouch in poor terms.
- Fully realize the intended decentralized trust mechanism described in the whitepaper.

This may undermine the network's credibility and the utility of vouching as a trust mechanism.

### Mitigation

```solidity
function markUnhealthy(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused {
    Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
    uint256 callerProfileId = IEthosProfile(
        contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE)
    ).verifiedProfileIdForAddress(msg.sender);

    _vouchShouldExist(vouchId);
    _vouchShouldBePossibleUnhealthy(vouchId);

    // Allow either the author (voucher) or the subject (vouchee) to mark unhealthy
    if (
        v.authorProfileId != callerProfileId &&
        v.subjectProfileId != callerProfileId
    ) {
        revert NotAuthorOrSubjectForVouch(vouchId, callerProfileId);
    }

    v.unhealthy = true;
    v.activityCheckpoints.unhealthyAt = block.timestamp;

    emit MarkedUnhealthy(v.vouchId, v.authorProfileId, v.subjectProfileId);
}
