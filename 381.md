# A mallicious user can avoid a slashing event during the evaluation period of the slasher contract

### Summary

The `unvouch:452`function have no timeout between the unvouch and the unvouch execution. The consequence of that is that if a mallicious user is in the evaluation period (24h according to the whitepaper) before slashing the user can call unvouch to avoid his fund to be slashed. 

### Root Cause

In the `unvouch:452`there is no timeout between the unvouch and the unvouch execution. A user can unvouch at any time as we can see :

### Internal pre-conditions

1. exitFees must be less than the slash percent.

### External pre-conditions

1. A mallicious user have been accused of dishonest behavior
2. He is in the evaluation period 

### Attack Path

1. Bob see that he is accused of unethical behavior and he is in an evaluation period 
2. He call `unvouch` to avoid the slash.

### Impact

The mallicious user will avoid the slashing.

### PoC

none.
### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue the protocol should set a timeout of at least 24 hours between the unvouch call and the unvouch execution.
