# Corruptible Upgradability Pattern

### Summary

The  EthosVouch and ReputationMarket are UUPSUpgradeable. However, the storage of them might be corrupted during an upgrade.

### Root Cause

The Ethos contracts are meant to be upgradeable. However, it inherits contracts that are not upgrade-safe.
They are not simply linearly inherited but have a complex hierarchical relationship.

Among them, the contracts highlighted in yellow occupy storage slots.
Both the `AccessControl` contract and the `SignatureControl` contract use storage slots but do not implement a gap.
This will cause storage corruption and conflicts when new storage slots are added during upgrades to the `AccessControl` and `SignatureControl` contracts.
Additionally, the contract also inherits the non-upgradeable component `ReentrancyGuard`.

### Internal pre-conditions

If admin performs an upgrade and wants to add another storage slot in AccessControl or SignatureControl contract, the storage slot would mess up.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Storage conflicts may occur during the upgrade process.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. Use the EIP-1967 proxy storage slot standard or add a gap.
2. Use `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` instead of `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable`
