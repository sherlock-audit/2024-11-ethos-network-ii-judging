# `EthosVouch::increaseVouch` allows vouching in a paused state.

### Summary

Missing `whenNotPaused` modifier on `EthosVouch::increaseVouch` allows vouching in a paused state.

The `EthosVouch` contract includes a pause mechanism designed to halt functionality during emergencies or unforeseen issues. Key functions such as `vouchByAddress`, `vouchByProfileId`, `unvouch`, and `unvouchUnhealthy` are appropriately secured with the `whenNotPaused` modifier from OpenZeppelin. However, the `increaseVouch` function lacks this modifier, enabling users to continue vouching even when the contract is paused.

### Root Cause

In [`EthosVouch::increaseVouch::l.426`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426) there is a missing modifier `whenNotPaused` not applied.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Allowing the `increaseVouch` function to bypass the pause state undermines the contract's emergency controls. This inconsistency may lead to misleading behavior, where users assume the entire contract is paused while some functionality remains active. Such behavior could potentially expose the contract to further risks or create confusion for its users.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the whenNotPaused modifier to the increaseVouch function to align its behavior with the intended pause functionality and ensure consistent application of the contract's emergency controls.
