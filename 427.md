# Attacker will manipulate vote prices, causing financial loss to users

### Summary

The missing slippage protection in [`ReputationMarket::sellVotes()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495-L534) will cause significant financial loss for users as an attacker can front-run the sale transaction to manipulate the vote prices.

### Root Cause

In `ReputationMarket::sellVotes()`, there is no slippage check before executing the sell transaction, allowing an attacker to manipulate the price by front-running. The vulnerability arises because, without slippage protection, an attacker can buy votes in the opposite direction (distrust) just before a large sell transaction, skewing the price in their favor.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A user (e.g., User A) holds a large position in votes (e.g., 100 TRUST votes).
2. The attacker (User B) monitors the market and sees a large sell order.
3. The attacker can quickly buy votes in the opposite direction (e.g., 100 DISTRUST votes) to manipulate the price.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User A submits a transaction to sell 100 TRUST votes in the market, which is visible in the mempool.
2. User B monitors the mempool and observes User A’s transaction details.
3. User B submits a transaction to buy 100 DISTRUST votes with a higher gas fee, causing it to execute before User A's transaction.
4. User B’s action alters the market dynamics, reducing the price of TRUST votes.
5. User A’s transaction executes after User B’s, leading to a significantly reduced return for User A due to the manipulated market conditions.

### Impact

The user (User A) suffers a loss of funds due to the manipulated market price. The attacker (User B) profits by buying and selling votes at favorable prices due to the lack of slippage protection.

### PoC

## Scenario Details:

- Total votes: 150 (120 TRUST + 30 DISTRUST)
- User A's votes: 100 TRUST votes.
- Market's base price: Assume 1 ETH for simplicity.
- User B buys 100 DISTRUST votes.

### Step 1: Calculate the price for TRUST votes
The function calculates the price of a vote as:
```sh
Price of a vote = (votes of selected type * base price) / total votes
```
Since User A is selling TRUST votes, we calculate the price of TRUST votes before the sale.

**Before Sale:**

- Votes of TRUST = 120
- Votes of DISTRUST = 30
- Total votes = 120 + 30 = 150
- Base price = 1 ETH

Using the formula:
```sh
Price per TRUST vote = (120 * 1 ETH) / 150 = 0.8 ETH
```
### Step 2: User B’s action
User B monitors pending transactions in the mempool and identifies User A’s intent to sell 100 TRUST votes, and since User B wants to profit, User B submits a higher-gas transaction to ensure their buy of 100 DISTRUST votes is processed before User A’s sell transaction.

**After User B’s transaction:**

- User B buys 100 DISTRUST votes, increasing the DISTRUST vote count to 130.
- Total votes = 120 (TRUST) + 130 (DISTRUST) = 250

### Step 3: Calculate the new price after User B's purchase
Now, we calculate the price of TRUST votes after the market is imbalanced due to User B's actions.

**After the market imbalance:**

- Votes of TRUST = 120
- Votes of DISTRUST = 130
- Total votes = 120 + 130 = 250

Now, we calculate the price of TRUST votes after User B’s buy:
```sh
Price per TRUST vote = (120 * 1 ETH) / 250 = 0.48 ETH
```

### Step 4: User A's sale outcome
When User A tries to sell their 100 TRUST votes, the price has dropped due to the imbalance. Since User A is selling at the lower price, they will get less ETH than expected.

**Expected amount for 100 TRUST votes (before User B’s action):**

- 100 TRUST votes * 0.8 ETH per vote = 80 ETH

**Amount User A actually gets (after User B’s action):**

- 100 TRUST votes * 0.48 ETH per vote = 48 ETH

### Conclusion:
User A expected to receive 80 ETH for selling 100 TRUST votes, but after User B front-runs them by buying 100 DISTRUST votes, the price drops to 0.48 ETH per TRUST vote, resulting in User A receiving only 48 ETH.

This demonstrates how User B can exploit the lack of slippage protection to cause a loss for User A by front-running their transaction.

### Mitigation

To mitigate this vulnerability, implement a slippage protection check in the `ReputationMarket::sellVotes()` function, similar to the one used in the [`ReputationMarket::buyVotes()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L461) function. This would ensure that a user cannot sell votes at a price that deviates significantly from the expected price, protecting them from front-running attacks.
