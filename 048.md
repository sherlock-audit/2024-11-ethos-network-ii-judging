# `withdrawDonations()` does not check whether the address of a profileId is compromised, allows stealing the enitre donated amount

### Summary

The `withdrawDonations()` missed the `isAddressCompromised(msg.sender)` check before withdrawing the donations amount, 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L570

### Root Cause

Under a `profileId`, there can be multiple registered addresses including the main address. All these addresses are also maps back to the profileId also. If one of address get compromised, the main address can perform a `EthosProfile.deleteAddress()` call, this marks the `isAddressCompromised[compromiseAddress]` to true.

The issue here is that the established market under a `profileId` can still have a non-zero `donationEscrow[address]` balance for the compromised address, which can be steal simply by calling the `withdrawDonations()` function. 

### Attack Path

1. Alice `createMarket()` under a `profileId==1`, the `donationRecipient[1]` sets to `address(alice)`
2. Alice `updateDonationRecipient()` to `address(alice2)`, 
3. Market performed well, she received some donations, however, the current `donationRecipient[address(alice2)]` get compromised, 
4. Immediate action taken by Alice(the main address), calls `deleteAddress(alice2,true)`, marking the `address(alice2)` compromised there, 
> **Note:** To take action against compromised address, two steps required considering address(alice) is an EOA, 1). marks the address compromise to prevent any further damages to profile, 2). `updateDonationRecipient` on `ReputationMarket` to avoid giving away the collected donation

5. As another crucial step, Alice tries changing the `donationRecipient` by making a `updateDonationRecipient` call on the `ReputationMarket`
6. However, attacker saw changed compromised status for `address(alice2)`, and swiftly proceed to the `withdrawDonations()` before the Alice call lends first.

The attacker managed to steal the collected donation funds without needing to frontrun any of the txn(since its 2 step process).

### Impact
Donation funds can be steal by a compromised address, due to missing `isAddressCompromised` check before withdrawing.

### Mitigation

```diff
  function withdrawDonations() public whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
+   if (_ethosProfileContract.isAddressCompromised(msg.sender)) {
+         revert AddressCompromised(msg.sender); 
+   }
    uint256 amount = donationEscrow[msg.sender];
    if (amount == 0) {
      revert InsufficientFunds();
    }

    // Reset escrow balance before transfer to prevent reentrancy
    donationEscrow[msg.sender] = 0;

    // Transfer the funds
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{ value: amount }("");
    if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Donation withdrawal failed");

    emit DonationWithdrawn(msg.sender, amount);
    return amount;
  }
```
