# `isParticipant` and `participants` are not properly handled

### Summary

These 2 variables track all profiles who have been voted for (users bought votes for them). They are used to calculate the trust/distrust for the off-chain calculations and for graduation of each market.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L119-L123
```solidity
  // profileId => participant address
  // append only; don't bother removing. Use isParticipant to check if they've sold all their votes.
  mapping(uint256 => address[]) public participants;

  // profileId => participant => isParticipant
  mapping(uint256 => mapping(address => bool)) public isParticipant;
```


When users buy votes using `buyVotes` their vote count for the buyer is increased by the new amount and they are added to an array with all buyers for this `profileId` and a map that tracks if a user is part of this array.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L466-L478
```solidity
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += votesBought;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] += votesBought;

    // Add buyer to participants if not already a participant
    if (!isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender]) {
      participants[profileId].push(msg.sender);
      isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = true;
    }
```

However later when they sell their vote they are not removed from the array and map:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L495
```solidity
  function sellVotes(...) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);

    // calculate the amount of votes to sell and the funds received
    (
      uint256 votesSold,
      uint256 fundsReceived,
      ,
      uint256 protocolFee,
      uint256 minVotePrice,
      uint256 maxVotePrice
    ) = _calculateSell(markets[profileId], profileId, isPositive, amount);

    // update the market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;

    // apply protocol fees
    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);
    _sendEth(fundsReceived);

    // tally market funds
    marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
    emit VotesSold(
      profileId,
      msg.sender,
      isPositive,
      votesSold,
      fundsReceived,
      block.timestamp,
      minVotePrice,
      maxVotePrice
    );
    _emitMarketUpdate(profileId);
  }
```

This means that once  a user is added to that array he is never removed, even if  he sells 100% of his votes.

### Root Cause

`sellVotes` not removing users from `isParticipant` and `participants`

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User buys a vote for Alice and sells it in 1 TX (only pays a small fee) he is now a participant of Alice campaign


### Impact

User will be forever participants, no matter if they have sold 100% of their votes or not. Once a participant, always one

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Removing users from `isParticipant` if they sell 100% of their votes. Simple example:

```diff
    // update the market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;

+   if(votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[TRUST] == 0 && votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[DISTRUST] == 0){
+       isParticipant[profileId][msg.sender] = false;
+   }

    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);
    _sendEth(fundsReceived);
```
