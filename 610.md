# Reputation Market Owner can malciously increase their reputation and take all the profit as well.

### Summary

Market Owner can take all the profits by predicting that their Market Reputation increase or not. As they can buy or sell votes themselves.

### Root Cause

As `buyVotes::ReputationMarket.sol` and `sellVotes::ReputationMarket.sol` does not check that buyer or seller is Market owner, It allows Market Owner to Buy or sell their votes themselves in a way that increase their reputation.



### Internal pre-conditions

## Attack Path

1. Market Owner create a market for themselves that benefits them by predicting their reputation.
2. Owner buys trust votes and increase their Reputation, and gains votes and also the funds goes to owners.
3. When the Reputation goes down, it can sell distrust votes to gain the reputation back.

    uint256 expectedVotes,
    uint256 slippageBasisPoints
  ) public payable whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);
+  uint256 _profileId = _getProfileIdForAddress(marketOwner);
+    if (profileId == _profileId) revert MarketOwnerCannotBuy();
}
```

```diff
 function sellVotes(
    uint256 profileId,
    bool isPositive,
    uint256 amount
  ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
    _checkMarketExists(profileId);
+  uint256 _profileId = _getProfileIdForAddress(marketOwner);
