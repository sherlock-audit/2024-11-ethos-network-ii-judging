# In the `ReputationMarket.buyVotes` function, `marketFunds[profileId]` should not contain protocol entry fee and donation fee

### Summary

In the `ReputationMarket.buyVotes` function, it accures `fundsPaid` which also contains procotol and donation fee into `marketFunds[profileId]`.
In the `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` function, it transfers `marketFunds[profileId]` amount of ethers to authorized graduation withdrawal address. This means the contract transfers protocol entry fee and donation fee twice.
As a result, this causes the protocol's loss of funds.

### Root Cause

In the `ReputationMarket._calculateBuy` function, `fundsPaid` contains `protocolFee` and `donation` from [L978](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/tree/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L978).

```solidity
L978:    fundsPaid += protocolFee + donation;
```

In the `ReputationMarket.buyVotes` function, it transfers protocol fee to `protocolFeeAddress` from L464 and accrues the donation fee into `donationEscrow` variable which `donationRecipient` will claim later.
And `fundsPaid` is accrued into the `marketFunds[profileId]` variable from L481.

```solidity
L464:    applyFees(protocolFee, donation, profileId);
L481:    marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
```

In the `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` function, it transfers `marketFunds[profileId]` amount of ethers to authorized graduation withdrawal address.

```solidity
L675:    _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]);
```

As a result, it tries to transfer fee amount of ethers, too.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

1. None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

This causes the protocol's loss of funds.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

It is recommended to change the code in the `buyVotes` function as following:

```diff
-    marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
+    marketFunds[profileId] += (fundsPaid - protocolFee - donation);
```
