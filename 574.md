# Wrong fee calculation and distribution when creating or increasing a Vouch

### Summary

Wrong fee calculation and distribution when creating or increasing a Vouch

### Root Cause

In EthosVouch.sol, when a Vouch is created or increased, applyFees() function is used to calculate how much goes to Vouch's balance and how much is distributed in fees (protocolFee, donationFee and vouchersPoolFee). However, because of the used method to calculate them fees are not correctly calculated, distributed fees are always higher than what they should and therefore the balance despoited to the Vouch is lower than expected.

This happens because each applyFees() uses _calcFee() function, which takes the total and feeBP as parameters and returns what amount from that total is to be deposited and what is to be distributed as fees. This would work if only one fee existed, but in this case there are 3 different fees.

### Attack Path

A voucher creates a new Vouch for a given subjectProfileId. The value sent is 1 ETH (10**18 wei). Let's say protocolFee, donationFee and vouchersPoolFee are 200, 300 and 500 BP respectively. With this inputs, the returned result by applyFees() function is: 
toDeposit = 903646895651464468
totalFees = 96353104348535532

Let's calculate the value of each fee from 96353104348535532:
protocolFee = 96353104348535532 * 200 / (200+300+500) = 19.270.620.869.707.106
donationFee = 96353104348535532 * 300 / (200+300+500) = 28.905.931.304.560.659
protocolFee = 96353104348535532 * 500 / (200+300+500) = 48.176.552.174.267.766

Let's now calculate each fee from toDeposit amount and the fee in BP:
protocolFee = 903646895651464468 * 200 / 10000 = 18.072.937.913.029.289
donationFee = 903646895651464468 * 300 / 10000 = 27.109.406.869.543.934
protocolFee = 903646895651464468 * 500 / 10000 = 45.182.344.782.573.223

As you can see, each fee is a 6,6% higher to the expected value, making the balance of the Vouch receive less value than what it should. This can be verified quickly if total fee is calculated, in this case it would be 200+300+500 = 1000 BPS (10%). Now we check if totalFees is 10% of toDeposit: 903646895651464468 * 10 / 100 = 90364689565146446, which is clearly lower than real distributed fees: 96353104348535532. 

### Impact

Vouch balance receives a lower amount than it should, and therefore distributed value for the three mentioned fees is higher. As a result, protocol, subjectProfileId and previous vouchers of subjectProfileId receive more fees than expected; while Vouch balance is increased less than expected. This will happen each time a Vouch is created or each time value is increased for a Vouch, giving an advantage to fee receivers and penalizing Vouches.

### PoC

Test this in Remix, import Math library from OZ. Non-relevant parts have been removed to focus on the calculation of fees.
``` solidity
contract Fees{
  uint public constant BASIS_POINT_SCALE = 10000;
  uint public entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints = 200;
  uint public entryDonationFeeBasisPoints = 300;
  uint public entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints = 500;
  using Math for uint256;

  uint public constant ETH_VALUE = 1 ether;

  function applyFees(
        uint256 amount
    ) public view returns (uint256 toDeposit, uint256 totalFees) {
            // Calculate entry fees so that amount is total sent value and amount * feeBP / 10000 = absolute fee.
            //@audit summed fees are always less than expected because of the way they are calculated.
            uint256 protocolFee = calcFee(amount, entryProtocolFeeBasisPoints);
            uint256 donationFee = calcFee(amount, entryDonationFeeBasisPoints);
            uint256 vouchersPoolFee = calcFee(amount, entryVouchersPoolFeeBasisPoints);

        
            totalFees = protocolFee + donationFee + vouchersPoolFee;
            toDeposit = amount - totalFees;
            
          }

          function calcFee(uint256 total, uint256 feeBasisPoints) internal pure returns (uint256 fee) {
        /*
         * Formula derivation:
         * 1. total = deposit + fee
         * 2. fee = deposit * (feeBasisPoints/10000)
         * 3. total = deposit + deposit * (feeBasisPoints/10000)
         * 4. total = deposit * (1 + feeBasisPoints/10000)
         * 5. deposit = total / (1 + feeBasisPoints/10000)
         * 6. fee = total - deposit
         * 7. fee = total - (total * 10000 / (10000 + feeBasisPoints)) => total >= 10**14
         */
        return total - (total.mulDiv(BASIS_POINT_SCALE, (BASIS_POINT_SCALE + feeBasisPoints), Math.Rounding.Floor));
    }
}```

### Mitigation

To make a fair disitribution of fees, first of all add all the fee values in BPs, then call calcFee() with that aggregated fee value to get the real amount to be distributed on fees. Finally distribute total fee value for each fee taking into account the weight of that fee.

Example for our case => 
totalFeeValue = 200+300+500 = 1000 BP.
calcFee(10**18, totalFeeValue) => toDeposit = 909090909090909090, totalFees = 90909090909090910 
protocolFee = 90909090909090910 * 200 / 1000 = 18.181.818.181.818.182
donationFee = 90909090909090910 * 300 / 1000 = 27.272.727.272.727.273
vouchersPoolFee = 90909090909090910 * 500 / 1000 = 45.454.545.454.545.455

You can now check that protocolFee is 2%, donationFee is 3% and vouchersPoolFee is 5% of toDeposit.
