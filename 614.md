# Protocol's Money Drained Mistakenly

### Summary

The vulnerability occurs in the `ReputationMarket::sellVotes` function where marketFunds[profileId] is incorrectly subtracted by the amount excluding the protocol fee. This creates a scenario where marketFunds does not reflect the correct total, potentially allowing an authorized address to withdraw incorrect amounts when calling withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds.

### Root Cause

`marketFunds` is a variable that is being used to store the total funds currently invested in each market. Therefore, `marketFunds` is also used as a total funds to be withdrawn in case of graduated market. The variable only updated when new market has created, new votes has been bought, and votes sold.

When new market is created, it updates the `marketFunds` to `initialLiquidityRequired`. When someone buy votes for spesific market, the `marketFunds` is added with `fundsPaid` (total votePrice + protocol fee + donation). However, the problem is `marketFunds[profileId]` in `ReputationMarket::sellVotes` is substracted with amount that has been substracted with protocol fee that has been sent to the protocol fee address.

This vulnerabilities will allow authorized address to incorrectly withdraw the protocol fee by calling `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds`.

Scenario :

1. New market has created. `marketFunds` is set to `initialLiquidityRequired`.
2. Some user buy votes for spesific profile id. `marketFunds` added with (total votePrice + protocol fee + donation).
3. The same user sold their votes. `marketFunds` substracted with (total votePrice - protocol fee - donation).
4. `marketFunds` is left with `initialLiquidityRequired` + (amount left from 2 and 3 scenario).
5. The market graduated.
6. Authorized address calls `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds` with `marketFunds` as total amount.

```solidity

    _;

    // update the market state
    markets[profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;
    votesOwned[msg.sender][profileId].votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= votesSold;

    // apply protocol fees
    applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

    // send the proceeds to the seller
    _sendEth(fundsReceived);
    // tally market funds
@>  marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;

    emit VotesSold(profileId, msg.sender, isPositive, votesSold, fundsReceived, block.timestamp, minVotePrice,maxVotePrice);
    _;
  }
```

### Attack Path

No Attack Required


### Impact

1. If there are ETHs left in the protocol, then those ETHs will be mistakenly used to withdraw the graduated market funds to the authorized address and will lead to money loss for the protocol.
2. If there are no ETHs left in the protocol, then withdraw graduated market mechanism will simply fail.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Since this is pretty subjective, here is my recommendation:

1. Add protocol fee and donation to be substracted in `marketFunds` when user decide to sell their votes.
2. Protocol fee and donation aren't added to `marketFunds` when user decide to buy votes.
