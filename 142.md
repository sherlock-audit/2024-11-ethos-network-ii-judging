# Incorrect Fee Apply

### Summary
`marketFunds[profileId]` is greater than actual value.

### Root Cause
In the `buyVotes()` function, `marketFunds[profileId]` is increased including the protocol fees and donations.
In the `sellVotes()` function, `marketFunds[profileId]` is decreased to exclulding the the protocol fees.

### Impact
`marketFunds[profileId]` is greater than acutual funds invested in this market.
Thus, the `withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds()` function withdraw more than intended.

### PoC
ReputationMarket.sol
```solidity
        function withdrawGraduatedMarketFunds(uint256 profileId) public whenNotPaused {
            address authorizedAddress = contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(
                "GRADUATION_WITHDRAWAL"
            );
            if (msg.sender != authorizedAddress) {
                revert UnauthorizedWithdrawal();
            }
            _checkMarketExists(profileId);
            if (!graduatedMarkets[profileId]) {
                revert MarketNotGraduated();
            }
            if (marketFunds[profileId] == 0) {
                revert InsufficientFunds();
            }

675         _sendEth(marketFunds[profileId]);
            emit MarketFundsWithdrawn(profileId, msg.sender, marketFunds[profileId]);
            marketFunds[profileId] = 0;
        }

        function buyVotes(
            uint256 profileId,
            bool isPositive,
            uint256 expectedVotes,
            uint256 slippageBasisPoints
        ) public payable whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
            ...
477         uint256 refund = msg.value - fundsPaid;
            if (refund > 0) _sendEth(refund);

            // tally market funds
481         marketFunds[profileId] += fundsPaid;
            ...
        }
```
In the `buyVotes()` function, `marketFunds[profileId]` is increased by all funds sent by buyer including protocol fees and donations.

```solidity
        function sellVotes(
            uint256 profileId,
            bool isPositive,
            uint256 amount
        ) public whenNotPaused activeMarket(profileId) nonReentrant {
            ...
            applyFees(protocolFee, 0, profileId);

            // send the proceeds to the seller
            _sendEth(fundsReceived);
            // tally market funds
522:        marketFunds[profileId] -= fundsReceived;
            ...
        }
```
In the `sellVotes()` function, `marketFunds[profileId]` is only decreased the funds sent to the seller, excluding protocol fees.
