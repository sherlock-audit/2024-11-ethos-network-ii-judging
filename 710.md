# wrong logic is implemented in createMarketWithConfig(), which could revert the function

### Summary

whenever enforceCreationAllowList is true and creationAllowedProfileIds is allowed , then also it will result in reverting of the function

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L667C1-L685C4

/**
   * @dev Disables the allow list enforcement
   * Anyone may create a market for their own profile.
   * @param value true if profile can create their market, false otherwise.
   */
  function setAllowListEnforcement(bool value) public onlyAdmin whenNotPaused {
    enforceCreationAllowList = value;
  }

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

lets consider a scenario when enforce is set to true and user is allowed,

which means createMarket config should succeed and fucntion should go further. But here actually, when it is true it will revert.
so it will prove the comment wrong

### Impact

improper functioning of create market, and not working as intended and mentioned in comments

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

logic in if function should be changed for enforceAllow
