# `EthosVouch::increaseVouch()` lacks pausing Check

### Summary

Missing to add pausing check modifier when increasing a given vouch


### Root Cause

in `EthosVouch::increaseVouch()` the function is not checking weather the contract is in pausing state or not, allowing increasing vouches when the contract is paused.

[EthosVouch.sol#L426](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426)
```solidity
  // @audit `whenNotPaused` modifier is missing
  function increaseVouch(uint256 vouchId) public payable nonReentrant {
    // ...
  }
```

By checking the contract state we will see that all functions that result in Modifity Vouchs state or money transferring in/out are restricted with the pausing modifier. This includes:
- new Vouching (money in): `vouchByAddress()`, `vouchByProfileId()`,
- unVouching (money out): `unvouch()`, `unvouchUnhealthy()`, `markUnhealthy()`
- slashing (money out): `slash()`
- Claiming Rewards (money out): `claimRewards()`
- Some Admin Config functions: `setMinimumVouchAmount()`, `updateMaximumVouches()`, `updateUnhealthyResponsePeriod()`

As we can see all state-changing functions by users are restricted with `whenNotPaused` modifier. But `increaseVouch()` is missing that modifier, which will increase Vouch balance, rewards to Subject ID, rewards to previous vouchers. All this money will be unwithdrawable as all functions to withdraw is restricted with pausing.


### Internal pre-conditions

Contracts Gets paused for maintanance


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

- State Changes to Vouchs when the contract is in a pausing state (should not allow this) 


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add `whenNotPaused` modifier
