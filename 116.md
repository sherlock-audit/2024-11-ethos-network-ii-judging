# `unvouch` allows immediate withdrawals, permitting slashing evasion: pending withdrawal mechanism Missing

### Summary

The `unvouch` function in the `EthosVouch` contract allows users to withdraw their staked funds immediately after initiating an unvouch. This behavior enables users to evade slashing by withdrawing their funds before any slashing operation can be executed. According to the protocolâ€™s design, slashing should affect all staked funds, including those in the process of withdrawal. 

To address this, the `unvouch` function should implement a **two-step process**: users must first submit an **unvouch request**, and only after a **cooldown period** can they claim their funds. This ensures slashing can apply to pending withdrawals.


### Root Cause

The `unvouch` function processes both the unvouch request and the funds withdrawal in a single transaction, leaving no opportunity for slashing operations to affect the withdrawn funds.

Relevant Code:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L470-L478
```solidity
(uint256 toWithdraw, ) = applyFees(v.balance, false, v.subjectProfileId);
v.balance = 0;
(bool success, ) = payable(v.authorAddress).call{ value: toWithdraw }("");
if (!success) {
    revert FeeTransferFailed("Failed to send ETH to author");
}
```

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. A voucher creates a vouch and stakes ETH.
2. The voucher anticipates being slashed and calls `unvouch` to immediately withdraw funds.
3. The protocol cannot slash the funds as they have already been withdrawn.

### Impact

1. **Slashing Evasion**: Users can avoid slashing penalties by quickly withdrawing their funds after initiating an unvouch.
2. **Protocol Credibility**: Undermines the effectiveness of slashing as a deterrent for unethical behavior, reducing trust in the protocol.
3. **Potential Exploitation**: Malicious actors could exploit this loophole to avoid penalties, leaving honest users disadvantaged.

### Mitigation

1. **Add Pending Unvouch State**
   ```solidity
   struct PendingUnvouch {
       uint256 balance;
       uint256 unlockTime;
   }
   mapping(uint256 => PendingUnvouch) public pendingUnvouches;
   ```

2. **Modify `unvouch`**
   Replace immediate withdrawal with a pending unvouch state:
   ```solidity
   function unvouch(uint256 vouchId) public whenNotPaused nonReentrant {
       Vouch storage v = vouches[vouchId];
       _vouchShouldExist(vouchId);
       _vouchShouldBePossibleUnvouch(vouchId);

       if (v.authorAddress != msg.sender) {
           revert AddressNotVouchAuthor(vouchId, msg.sender, v.authorAddress);
       }

       v.archived = true;
       v.activityCheckpoints.unvouchedAt = block.timestamp;

       uint256 toWithdraw;
       (toWithdraw, ) = applyFees(v.balance, false, v.subjectProfileId);

       pendingUnvouches[vouchId] = PendingUnvouch({
           balance: toWithdraw,
           unlockTime: block.timestamp + 24 hours
       });

       v.balance = 0;

       emit UnvouchRequested(v.vouchId, v.authorProfileId, v.subjectProfileId, toWithdraw, block.timestamp + 24 hours);
   }
   ```

3. **Add `claimFunds`**
   Enable users to claim their funds after the cooldown period:
   ```solidity
   function claimFunds(uint256 vouchId) public nonReentrant {
       PendingUnvouch storage pending = pendingUnvouches[vouchId];

       if (pending.unlockTime == 0 || block.timestamp < pending.unlockTime) {
           revert FundsNotYetUnlocked(vouchId);
       }

       uint256 amount = pending.balance;
       delete pendingUnvouches[vouchId];

       (bool success, ) = payable(msg.sender).call{ value: amount }("");
       if (!success) {
           revert FeeTransferFailed("Failed to transfer funds");
       }

       emit FundsClaimed(vouchId, msg.sender, amount);
   }
   ```

4. **Modify `slash`**
   Ensure slashing affects pending withdrawals:
      ```solidity
    function slash(
        uint256 authorProfileId,
        uint256 slashBasisPoints
    ) external onlySlasher whenNotPaused nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
        if (slashBasisPoints > MAX_SLASH_PERCENTAGE) {
            revert InvalidSlashPercentage();
        }

        uint256 totalSlashed;
        uint256[] storage vouchIds = vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId];

        // Slash active vouches
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchIds.length; i++) {
            Vouch storage vouch = vouches[vouchIds[i]];
            if (!vouch.archived) {
                uint256 slashAmount = vouch.balance.mulDiv(
                    slashBasisPoints,
                    BASIS_POINT_SCALE,
                    Math.Rounding.Floor
                );
                if (slashAmount > 0) {
                    vouch.balance -= slashAmount;
                    totalSlashed += slashAmount;
                }
            }
        }

        // Slash pending unvouches
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < vouchIds.length; i++) {
            PendingUnvouch storage pending = pendingUnvouches[vouchIds[i]];
            if (pending.balance > 0) {
                uint256 slashAmount = pending.balance.mulDiv(
                    slashBasisPoints,
                    BASIS_POINT_SCALE,
                    Math.Rounding.Floor
                );
                if (slashAmount > 0) {
                    pending.balance -= slashAmount;
                    totalSlashed += slashAmount;
                }
            }
        }

        // Transfer total slashed to protocol fee address
        if (totalSlashed > 0) {
            (bool success, ) = protocolFeeAddress.call{ value: totalSlashed }("");
            if (!success) revert FeeTransferFailed("Slash transfer failed");
        }

        emit Slashed(authorProfileId, slashBasisPoints, totalSlashed);
        return totalSlashed;
    }
    ```
