# Rewards for Non-Verified Profiles Are Permanently Locked

### Summary

The [`EthosVouch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/57c02df7c56f0b18c681a89ebccc28c86c72d8d8/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L363) allow people to vouch for mock profiles in case they get verified later, however the `claimRewards` function in the `ReputationMarket` contract requires a profile to have been verified at some point to claim rewards. If the subject profile associated with rewards is never verified, the rewards remain permanently locked. This creates a scenario where the protocol accumulates unusable funds, leading to inefficiencies and user dissatisfaction.

### Root Cause

The claimRewards function enforces verification through the following condition:

```javascript
if (!verified || mock) {
    revert ProfileNotFoundForAddress(msg.sender);
}
```

This ensures that only verified, non-mock profiles can claim rewards. However, there is no mechanism to handle rewards associated with profiles that remain unverified indefinitely.

### Internal pre-conditions

`_depositRewards` is called to allocate rewards to a `recipientProfileId`.
The `recipientProfileId` belongs to an address that has never been verified through the `IEthosProfile` contract.

### External pre-conditions

The profile remains unverified indefinitely.

### Attack Path

This is more of an unrecoverable fund locking issue than an attack however it creaes a lock of funds scenario.

### Impact

Locked rewards create a financial inefficiency in the system, reducing the funds available for active participants.

### PoC

1. Scenario Setup
`_depositRewards` is called: `_depositRewards(100 ether, 12345); // Profile ID 12345`
The profile associated with `recipientProfileId = 12345` is never verified.
2. Attempt to Claim Rewards
The user with `profileId = 12345` calls claimRewards.
The function reverts with `ProfileNotFoundForAddress`, as the profile is unverified.
3. Locked Funds
The `rewards[12345]` value remains non-zero indefinitely, and the funds cannot be accessed.

### Mitigation
create a sweep mechanism:
```javascript
function recoverUnclaimedRewards(uint256 profileId) external onlyAdmin {
    if (IEthosProfile(contractAddressManager.getContractAddressForName(ETHOS_PROFILE))
        .profileStatusById(profileId).verified) revert ProfileStillValid();

    uint256 amount = rewards[profileId];
    rewards[profileId] = 0;
     (bool success, ) = payable(treasury).call{ value: toWithdraw }("");
; // Redirect to protocol treasury
    emit RewardsRecovered(profileId, amount);
}
```
