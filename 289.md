# Incorrect Vote Price Calculation in Sell Transaction

### Summary

A logical error in the vote price calculation mechanism will cause pricing inaccuracies for users as the current implementation incorrectly calculates funds received

### Root Cause

in `ReputationMarket.sol` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationMarket.sol#L1026-L1040 the vote price calculation logic incorrectly determines funds received by calculating the price after vote subtraction. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User needs to call `_calculateSell()` function to simulate sell votes
2. Market needs to have more than 1 vote of the specified type (TRUST/DISTRUST)



### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls `_calculateSell()` to simulate sell multiple votes
2. Function calculates vote price after subtracting each vote
3. `fundsReceived` accumulates prices based on subsequent vote prices
4. User receives incorrect total funds for votes sold

### Impact

1. The users suffer an incorrect receival of funds due to misaligned vote pricing. 
2. The protocol risks financial discrepancies in vote transactions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the implementation to calculate and accumulate vote prices before subtracting votes 

```solidity

uint256 votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
uint256 maxPrice = votePrice;
uint256 minPrice;
while (votesSold < amount) {
  if (market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] <= 1) {
    revert InsufficientVotesToSell(profileId);
  }
  votePrice = _calcVotePrice(market, isPositive);
  fundsReceived += votePrice;
  market.votes[isPositive ? TRUST : DISTRUST] -= 1;
  votesSold++;
}
```
