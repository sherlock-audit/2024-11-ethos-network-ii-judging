# Attacker can manipulate reputation prices in default tier affecting market integrity

### Summary

The choice to use a simple bonding curve with low initial votes is a mistake as it allows attackers to manipulate reputation prices, impacting the integrity of the market. An attacker will exploit the low liquidity and vote count in the Default tier to create artificial price swings.

### Root Cause

The choice to use a simple bonding curve with only 1 initial vote for trust and distrust in the Default tier is a mistake as it allows for significant price manipulation with minimal effort.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The Default tier market configuration sets `initialVotes` to exactly 1 for both trust and distrust.
2. The Default tier market configuration sets `initialLiquidity` to exactly 0.02 ETH.

### External pre-conditions

The market must be newly created with no additional trades affecting the initial state.

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `buyVotes` to purchase 9 trust votes, significantly increasing the trust price.
2. Attacker calls `buyVotes` to purchase 4 distrust votes, causing a large drop in distrust price.
3. Attacker calls `buyVotes` again to purchase more trust votes at the now lower price.
4. Attacker repeats the process to profit from the price differential.

### Impact

The market suffers a loss of integrity as reputation prices no longer reflect genuine sentiment. The attacker gains by exploiting price swings, potentially profiting from arbitrage opportunities.

### PoC

1. A new market is created with the Default tier configuration.
2. Initial state: 1 trust vote, 1 distrust vote, 0.02 ETH liquidity.
3. Attacker buys 9 trust votes, changing the ratio to 10:1.
4. Trust price increases significantly, distrust price drops.
5. Attacker buys 4 distrust votes, changing the ratio to 10:5.
6. Trust price drops, allowing the attacker to buy more trust votes cheaply.
7. Attacker repeats the cycle, profiting from the manipulated price swings.

### Mitigation

1. Increase the initial votes in the Default tier to at least 100 for both trust and distrust.
2. Implement a time-weighted average price mechanism to reduce the impact of rapid trades.
3. Introduce a minimum time delay between large trades to prevent rapid manipulation.
4. Consider increasing initial liquidity to provide more price stability.
