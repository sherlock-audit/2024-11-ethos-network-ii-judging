# The slashing mechanism is Staker Dependent only

### Summary

Slashing Mechanism is implemented as: slashing is applied to the staker affecting all his staking in different Staking Pools, not in the Staking Pool itself affecting all the stakers in that Pool.


### Root Cause

In the Slashing mechanism, we slash authors by decreasing all there balance in all vouches for different subjected profiles. We use `vouchIdsByAuthor` to get all profiles vouched by that single author and reduce their balance.

[EthosVouch.sol#L529](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-11-ethos-network-ii/blob/main/ethos/packages/contracts/contracts/EthosVouch.sol#L529)
```solidity
  function slash( ... ) external onlySlasher whenNotPaused nonReentrant returns (uint256) {
    if (slashBasisPoints > MAX_SLASH_PERCENTAGE) {
      revert InvalidSlashPercentage();
    }

    uint256 totalSlashed;
>>  uint256[] storage vouchIds = vouchIdsByAuthor[authorProfileId];
    ...
  }
```

As stated in Etos Docs [link](https://whitepaper.ethos.network/ethos-mechanisms/vouch#financial-stakes)
> The amount of Ethereum staked represents the magnitude of the trust placed in you. Ethos does not differentiate between one person who vouches for you with 10,000Îž or 10,000 people who vouch for you with one Ethereum.

The stake is the magnitude of trust placed in you, vouching for a given profile (subject profile) means people trust this profile and stake money with it.

Take Lido for example: This process is like people trust Lido, and they deposit money in his contract.

In Lido, if slashing is to occur, all users' balance gets decreased, and this is the right case, as the Protocol that people trust, and put money in was not good and gets slashed, so all investors gets affected.

But Ethos contract slashing is not implemented like this, we decrease `authors` themselves regarding how many subject profiles they vouch for and whether they are subjected to slashing or not.

This state is like Yield Strategy Protocol, where one user can stake in more than one Staking Pool. Now how does slashing occur in Yield Strategy?

When slashing occurs to a given Pool all users stake in that Pool gets their balance decreases, not by slashing a single user by decreasing his balance in all Pools he stake in.

So if a subjected profile is subjected to slash, all stakers (users vouches for him and trust him should get punished), not author profile themselves (stakers) gets slashed for all Subject profiles they vouch for (staking pools they staked in) 

In addition, The state in Ethos is actually Mutual, where in Staking users are static parties, and Staking Pools (in Yield Strategy) are the parties that is subjected to punishment (slashing). But in Ethos it is a mutual relation where author profiles trust subjected profiles like staking by vouching for them, and author profiles themselves can be malicious, so Slashing can occuar to Author profiles themselves too in need, but as we stated earlier slashing occuar to Pool.

So in Breif, Slashing Process should slash a subjected profile by decreasing all stakers (profiles vouchs for him), not slashing an author profile by slashing all his stakes in all Pools (subject profiles). And implementing a mechanism to slash all stakes for a given author profile is also OK, as The state is Mutual in Ethos.

Make the slash function accept a parameter that identifies whether the slashing is to occur for the Staking Pool (Subjected profile) or the Staker himself (Author Profile).
